Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings. © 2021 Maryam Zare Jeddi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","fluorocarbon; adult; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; human; meta analysis; metabolic syndrome X; pollutant; toxicity; Adult; Child; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome"

However, they are usually coated with hazardous substances, such as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs). PFASs, with its functional properties of oil- and water-repellency, can migrate from FCMs into the food and cause potential risk to human health. There are also increasing concerns about the harm that FCMs can cause to the environment. These concerns include accumulation of non-degradable plastics in the environment, generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics, and release of PFASs from FCMs. While many reviews have been conducted on PFASs in the environment, including their occurrence, fate, toxicity, biodegradation, migration in ecosystems and remediation technologies, a systematic review of PFASs in FCMs and MPs is currently lacking. In addition, our knowledge of the PFAS sorption processes on MPs is rather limited, and in particular their desorption processes. Thus, this review aims to (1) review the presence of various classes of PFASs in FCMs and their migration into food, (2) review the PFASs in MPs and summarize the sorption mechanisms, and factors that influence their sorption behaviour on MPs in the aquatic environment, and (3) identify the current research gaps and future research directions to predict the risks associated with the presence and sorption of PFASs in FCMs and MPs. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","acetic acid; alcohol derivative; carboxylic acid; fluorotelomer alcohol; inorganic compound; microplastic; nanoplastic; organofluorine derivative; organophosphate; perfluoro compound; phosphinic acid derivative; phosphonic acid derivative; polymer; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; plastic; biodegradation; chemical substance; desorption; health risk; mortality risk; plastic; risk; risk factor; adsorption; aquatic environment; biodegradation; butter; cereal; classification; dangerous goods; desorption; ecosystem restoration; ecotoxicology; environmental factor; fluorination; food; food packaging; health hazard; hydrophobicity; information retrieval; microplastic pollution; milk; nonhuman; pollution transport; Review; ScienceDirect; search engine; static electricity; Web of Science; ecosystem; human; water pollutant; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Microplastics; Plastics; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human biomonitoring measurements. Methods: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail. Results: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals. © 2022","Dust; Potable water; Risk perception; Exposure pathways; House dust; Human exposures; Indoor air; Indoor exposure; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Residential environment; Serum concentration; Systematic Review; Consumer products; cosmetic; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); dust; indoor air; organohalogen; pollution exposure; ambient air; Article; artificial intelligence; blood sampling; Caucasian; cleaning; concentration (parameter); consumer; environmental exposure; evidence based practice; house dust; household; human; indoor environment; inhalation; machine learning; population structure; risk factor; sex difference; social participation; social status; systematic review; biological monitoring; chemistry; culture medium; dust; female; pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Biological Monitoring; Culture Media; Drinking Water; Dust; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans"

Recent Findings: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), non-pregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate (n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems. Conclusions: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison. Future studies should consider potential differences in study methodology, use of prospective design, and influence from confounding bias and measurement errors. © 2022","Amino acids; Biomolecules; Cytology; Fatty acids; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Organic pollutants; Physiology; Search engines; Urea; Epidemiological studies; Exposome; Human study; Metabolic pathways; Metabolomes; Metabolomics; Non-targeted; Perfluorinated compounds; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Scoping review; Metabolism; carnitine; fatty acid; glycerophospholipid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; purine; pyrimidine; tricarboxylic acid; tryptophan; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; epidemiology; fatty acid; lipid; metabolism; metabolite; oxidation; persistent organic pollutant; physiology; adolescent; adult; aged; amino acid metabolism; biomembrane; blood analysis; cell energy; citric acid cycle; comparative study; energy resource; environmental exposure; epidemiology; fatty acid oxidation; female; human; lipid metabolism; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; metabolic regulation; metabolomics; middle aged; pregnant woman; publication; purine metabolism; pyrimidine metabolism; Review; sample size; urea cycle; urinalysis; child; metabolomics; pollutant; pregnancy; prospective study; Adolescent; Adult; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Child; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolomics; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies"

Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health. Objectives: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect. Methods: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers. Results: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures’ effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16). Conclusion: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are warranted. © 2021","alkyl group; environmental chemical; perfluoroalkanoic acid; sex hormone; thyroid hormone; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; thyroid hormone; chemical substance; health impact; literature review; pollution exposure; public health; statistical analysis; adolescent; adult; aged; Bayes theorem; child; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; clinical outcome; controlled study; environmental exposure; Europe; female; fetus development; health hazard; homeostasis; hormone metabolism; human; immunotoxicity; k means clustering; least square analysis; male; nerve cell differentiation; nervous system development; North America; outcome assessment; population exposure; Review; risk assessment; structural equation modeling; systematic review; thyroid gland; pollutant; toxicity; Europe; North America; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Bayes Theorem; Child; Environmental Pollutants; Europe; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Thyroid Hormones"

Only meta-analyses and review articles were included, as they provide more extensive evidence compared to individual studies. The collected evidence indicated that lead (Pb), phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are moderately to highly associated with ADHD. Limited evidence exists for an association between ADHD and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, mercury (Hg), and pesticides. The evidence of association between ADHD and cadmium (Cd) and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based on the identified reviews was low but justified further research. The methods of the individual studies included in the reviews and meta-analyses covered in the current paper varied considerably. Making precise conclusions in terms of the strength of evidence on association between certain chemicals and ADHD was not straightforward.

This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Results: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86–1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86–1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.16) respectively. Conclusion: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health.

Due to their unique chemical properties, widespread production, environmental distribution, long-term persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and associated risks for human health, PFAS have been classified as persistent organic pollutants of significant concern. Scientific evidence from the last several decades suggests that their widespread occurrence in the environment correlates with adverse effects on human health and ecology. The presence of PFAS in the aquatic environment demonstrates a close link between the anthroposphere and the hydrological cycle, and concentrations of PFAS in surface and groundwater range in value along the ng L−1–μg L−1 scale. Here, we critically reviewed the research published in the last decade on the global occurrence and distribution of PFAS in the aquatic environment. Ours is the first paper to critically evaluate the occurrence of PFAS at the continental scale and the evolving global regulatory responses to manage and mitigate the adverse human health risks posed by PFAS. The review reports that PFAS are widespread despite being phased out—they have been detected in different continents irrespective of the level of industrial development. Their occurrence far from the potential sources suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is an important pathway of PFAS distribution. Recently, several studies have investigated the health impacts of PFAS exposure—they have been detected in biota, drinking water, food, air, and human serum. In response to the emerging information about PFAS toxicity, several countries have provided administrative guidelines for PFAS in water, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Australia. In the US, additional regulatory measures are under consideration. Further, many PFAS have now been listed as persistent organic pollutants. This comprehensive review provides crucial baseline information on the global occurrence, distribution, and regulatory framework of PFAS. © 2021","Atmospheric movements; Groundwater; Health; Health risks; Potable water; Aquatic environments; Environmental pollutions; Global regulatories; Human health; Occurrence and distribution; Perfluoroalkyl substances; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Organic pollutants; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; human; wastewater; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Drinking Water; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, −0.022; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, −0.017; 95% CI, −0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level.

PFAS can be distinguished, among other things, by their different carbon chain lengths and functional groups. The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs.

The etiology of preterm birth has not yet been elucidated. Although maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk for preterm birth, associations have not been confirmed. We performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationships between maternal exposure to EDCs and preterm birth. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid-EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies providing quantitative data on the association between maternal EDC exposure and preterm birth in humans was conducted in July 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. A total of 59 studies were included. The pooled results indicated that maternal exposure to metals (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.29) and phthalates (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.42) was related to an increased risk for preterm birth. Specifically, maternal exposure to lead, cadmium, chromium, copper and manganese appeared to be correlated with an elevated risk for preterm birth. Additionally, maternal exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was also associated with preterm birth.

In this comprehensive worldwide review, we collected ecotoxicology and concentration data observed in surface water for 53 high-potency EDs and performed a risk assessment. The compounds were selected from the EU watchlist of priority substances, expanded with new compounds of emerging concern (total 41), where quantifiable data were available for the past three years (2018–2020). The risk quotients ranged from <0.01 for 22 substances to 1974 for tamoxifen. The frequency of samples in which the predicted no-effect concentrations were exceeded also varied, from 1.8% to 92.7%. By using the comprehensive multi-parameter risk assessment in our study, the most current to date, we determined that tamoxifen, imidacloprid, clothianidin, four bisphenols (BPA, BPF, BPS, and BPAF), PFOA, amoxicillin, and three steroid hormones (estriol, estrone, and cyproterone) pose significant risks in the environment. Comparing two structurally very similar bisphenols, BPA and BPB, suggested that the risk from BPB is currently underestimated by at least four orders of magnitude due to the lack of ecotoxicological data availability. The methodological limitations encountered suggest that a standardized methodology for data selection and assessment is necessary, highlighting the fact that some substances are currently under-represented in the field of ecotoxicological research. A new prioritization system is therefore presented, which provides a potential basis for new substances to be included in environmental monitoring lists. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic organisms; Ecology; Endocrine disrupters; Endocrinology; Phenols; Steroid hormones; Surface waters; Bisphenols; Eco-toxicology; Ecotoxicological; Endocrine-disruptors; Multi-parameter risk assessment; Multiparameters; Priority index; Property; Risks assessments; Tamoxifen; Risk assessment; acetamiprid; amoxicillin; androstenedione; azithromycin; bazedoxifene; beta lactam antibiotic; ciprofloxacin; clarithromycin; clomifene; clothianidin; corticosterone; cyproterone; desogestrel; endocrine disruptor; erythromycin; estradiol; estriol; estrone; ethinylestradiol; gentamicin; imidacloprid; macrolide; metaflumizone; methiocarb; ospemifene; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; phenol derivative; progesterone; quinolone derivative; raloxifene; surface water; tamoxifen; testosterone; thiacloprid; thiamethoxam; tibolone; tobramycin; toremifene; unclassified drug; endocrine disruptor; ecotoxicology; endocrine disruptor; environmental monitoring; methodology; risk assessment; secondary metabolite; surface water; acute toxicity; aquatic environment; aquatic species; Article; data availability; ecotoxicology; effective concentration; environmental monitoring; geographic distribution; health hazard; information retrieval; no-observed-effect concentration; peer review; persistent organic pollutant; publication; risk assessment; sampling; Scopus; search engine; surface property; Web of Science; ecotoxicology; human; Aquatic Organisms; Ecotoxicology; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment"

Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Objective: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. Methods: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: “Endocrine disruptor(s)” OR “Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)” OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND “Breast cancer” to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. Results: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. Conclusion: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations. © 2021 The Author(s).

Current knowledge supports the notion that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with human metabolism and hormonal balance, contributing to the conventionally recognized lifestyle-related MetS risk factors. This review aims to identify epidemiological studies focusing on the association between MetS or its individual components (e.g., obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension) and eight HBM4EU priority substances (bisphenol A (BPA), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides and heavy metals (cadmium, arsenic and mercury)). Thus far, human biomonitoring (HBM) studies have presented evidence supporting the role of EDC exposures on the development of individual MetS components. The strength of the association varies between the components and EDCs. Current evidence on metabolic disturbances and EDCs is still limited and heterogeneous, and mainly represent studies from North America and Asia, highlighting the need for well-conducted and harmonized HBM programmes among the European population. Rigorous and ongoing HBM in combination with health monitoring can help to identify the most concerning EDC exposures, to guide future risk assessment and policy actions. © 2021 by the authors.

This is not fully explained by established risk factors. Concurrent, increasing exposure to antiandrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in fetal life may partially explain this trend. This systematic review assessed available evidence regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure and risk of testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior to December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase® was performed. Among the 279 identified records, 19 were eligible for quality assessment and 10 for further meta-analysis. The completeness of reporting was high across papers, but over 50% were considered subject to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis was 31.9 years. None considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The meta-analyses showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring [summary risk ratios: 2.16, (95% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78 (95% CI:2.27-3.41) for all, seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively]. Similarly, high maternal exposures to grouped organochlorines and organohalogens were associated with higher risk of seminoma and nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal adult male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However, the quality of studies was mixed, and considering the fields complexity, more prospective studies of prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture exposures and testicular cancer are needed. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Integrated crop–livestock systems combine agricultural crop production with milk and/or meat production and processing. Key sources of PFAS in these systems include firefighting foams near military bases, wastewater sludge and industrial discharge. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances regularly move from soils to nearby surface water and/or groundwater because of their high mobility and persistence. Irrigating crops or managing livestock for milk and meat production using adjacent waters can be detrimental to human health. The presence of PFAS in both groundwater and milk have been reported in dairy production states (e.g., Wisconsin and New Mexico) across the United States. Although there is a limit of 70 parts per trillion of PFAS in drinking water by the U.S. EPA, there are not yet regional screening guidelines for conducting risk assessments of livestock watering as well as the soil and plant matrix.

Through subgroup analysis, we found that PFOS concentration of children’s blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD were statistically positively correlated, and there was also a positive correlation between PFOS exposure and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD in the America. Moreover, there was also a statistically positive correlation between PFNA concentration in maternal blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD. Sensitivity analysis showed that the final results did not change much, the sensitivity was low, and the results were relatively stable.

Several advisory guidelines were proposed worldwide aimed at limiting their occurrences in the aquatic environments, especially for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). This review paper aims to provide a holistic review in the emerging area of PFAS research by summarizing the spatiotemporal variations in PFAS concentrations in surface water systems globally, highlighting the possible trends of occurrences of PFAS, and presenting potential human health impacts as a result of PFAS exposure through surface water matrices. From the data analysis in this study, occurrences of PFOA and PFOS in many surface water matrices were observed to be several folds higher than the US EPA health advisory level of 70 ng/L for lifetime exposure from drinking water. Direct discharge and atmospheric deposition were identified as primary sources of PFAS in surface water and cryosphere, respectively. While global efforts focused on limiting usages of long-chain PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA, the practices of using short-chain PFAS such as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and PFAS alternatives increased substantially. These compounds are also potentially associated with adverse impacts on human health, animals and biota. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental Protection Agency; Meteorological problems; Potable water; Surface waters; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Environmental health; Environmental health, health geography; Global trends; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Poly-fluoroalkyl substance; Stormwaters; United States environmental protection agency; Water matrices; Health; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; sulfonic acid derivative; analysis; animal; government; human; toxicity; United States; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Drinking Water; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Sulfonic Acids; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The aim of the present study was to systematically review and evaluate the human evidence on the associations between internal levels of POPs and in vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes among women. We applied a protocol based on the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and Translation's guidelines for the study search, selection and quality assessment. Fifteen studies were finally retained in the present work. The results showed that main families of POPs are still pervasive in follicular fluid and serum of women undergoing IVF treatments. Globally, we found inconsistent findings across studies for specific exposure-outcome dyads, suggesting that adverse effects of POPs on IVF outcomes cannot be ruled out. Specifically, there is evidence that POPs, notably some polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides, may impair embryo quality and pregnancy rates. Most studies have been performed in small cohorts (n<50) and focused on PCBs and OCPs, whereas major research gaps remain for emerging compounds (e.g. perfluoroalkylated substances) and the most clinically relevant outcome, live birth rate. The overall evidence presented ‘serious’ or ‘very serious’ risk of bias, mainly due to the lack of consideration of relevant confounding variables, low sample size or underreporting of methods. Globally, we judged the level of evidence being “low”. Given the high economical and societal costs associated to infertility and IVF, further well-designed research is urged to fill the highlighted gaps. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","biological marker; organochlorine pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; adult; Article; birth rate; clinical outcome; embryotoxicity; environmental exposure; female; female infertility; human; in vitro fertilization; live birth; major clinical study; ovary follicle fluid; persistent organic pollutant; pregnancy rate; reproductive toxicity; systematic review; blood; environmental exposure; pregnancy; treatment outcome; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fertilization in Vitro; Humans; Persistent Organic Pollutants; Pregnancy; Treatment Outcome"

The prevalence of allergic diseases in childhood is gradually increasing all over the world in recent decades. Known causes of these diseases include anomalous immune responses and allergic inflammatory reactions, but the causes of allergic diseases in childhood are complex. Data sources: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science were searched for articles focusing on environmental exposure during pregnancy and the risk of childhood allergic diseases, including asthma and atopic dermatitis, and the possible underlying mechanism. Results: In terms of environmental factors, allergic diseases in childhood are closely related to environmental chemical exposure during pregnancy, including bisphenols, phthalates acid esters, perfluorochemicals, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and polychlorinated biphenyls. However, allergic diseases in childhood are also closely associated with maternal dietary nutrition, maternal intake of drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), paracetamol and antibiotics, and maternal lifestyle. Conclusions: Several harmful environmental factors during pregnancy can result in the interruption of the function of helper T cells (Th1/Th2), cytokines and immunoglobulins and may activate allergic reactions, which can lead to allergic diseases during childhood. © 2021, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acetylsalicylic acid; antibiotic agent; environmental chemical; ester; paracetamol; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; allergic disease; asthma; atopic dermatitis; blood placenta barrier; childhood disease; dietary exposure; environmental exposure; environmental factor; epigenetic modification; human; lifestyle; maternal exposure; maternal nutrition; persistent organic pollutant; pregnancy; prenatal drug exposure; Review; social aspect; adverse event; asthma; atopic dermatitis; diet; environmental exposure; female; hypersensitivity; pregnancy; Asthma; Dermatitis, Atopic; Diet; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Pregnancy"

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of these associations. Methods: The online databases PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched comprehensively for eligible studies from inception to February 2021. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random- or fixed-effects models, and dose-response meta-analyses were also conducted when possible. Findings: A total of 29 studies (32,905 participants) were included. The pooled results demonstrated that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure during pregnancy was linearly associated with increased preterm birth risk (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.01, 95% CIs: 1.00–1.02, P = 0.009) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) exposure showed inverted U-shaped associations with preterm birth risk (P values for the nonlinear trend: 0.025 and 0.030). Positive associations were also observed for exposure to perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) and miscarriage (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.87, 95% CIs: 1.15–3.03) and PFOS and preeclampsia (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 1.27, 95% CIs: 1.06–1.51), whereas exposure to perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) was inversely associated with preeclampsia risk (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 0.81, 95% CIs: 0.71–0.93). Based on individual evidence, detrimental effects were observed between PFDA exposure and small for gestational age and between PFOA and PFOS and intrauterine growth restriction. No significant associations were found between pregnancy PFAS exposure and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e., gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birth weight, and large and small for gestational age). Interpretation: Our findings indicated that PFOS, PFOA and PFNA exposure during pregnancy might be associated with increased preterm birth risk and that PFAS exposure might be associated with the risk of miscarriage and preeclampsia.

Ubiquitous exposures to PFAS, in consideration of their persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and toxicities have led to concerns regarding possible harmful effects during critical periods of development in early-life and long-term consequences on health. The potential effects of PFAS depend on various factors including the type of PFAS and the timing and level of exposure. We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature to assess the effects of early-life PFAS exposure on prenatal and postnatal growth, adiposity, and puberty in children and adolescents. For birth size, most studies indicated that prenatal PFAS exposure, in particular long-chain PFAS, may impair fetal growth, albeit some reports of null associations with maternal PFAS. For growth within 2 years of age, prenatal PFAS exposure showed no associations with height and either null or negative associations with weight. However, postnatal PFAS exposures were inversely related to height and weight at 2 years in a cross-sectional study. For postnatal adiposity, prenatal PFAS may mostly have negative associations with body mass index in the first 2 years of life, but positive relationships with adiposity in childhood and adolescence, although some studies showed null associations. For puberty, the evidence for associations between early-life PFAS exposure and pubertal development or sex hormone levels were limited and inconclusive. From experimental studies, plausible mechanisms through which PFAS may affect early-life growth and puberty include PFAS-induced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, alterations of thyroid or steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, and their weak estrogenic or anti-androgenic properties. Although the published literature suggests possible effects of PFAS exposures on early-life growth, adiposity, and puberty, current human evidence is limited in establishing PFAS-induced effects on early-life physical development. Further investigation is warranted to clarify PFAS-induced effects on growth and physical development in consideration of the critical time-window of exposure, concomitant exposure to chemical mixtures including various PFAS types, and possible non-monotonic dose-response relationship for growth and adiposity trajectories. © Copyright © 2021 Lee, Jung, Kim, Choi and Lee.","alkyl group; estradiol; follitropin; luteinizing hormone; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; polyfluoroalkyl substance; steroid hormone; testosterone; thyroid hormone; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; birth length; birth weight; body fat; body height; body mass; body weight; childhood obesity; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; environmental exposure; fetus growth; fluorination; gestational age; hormone metabolism; hormone synthesis; human; long term exposure; menarche; meta analysis; physical parameters; ponderal index; postnatal growth; precocious puberty; prenatal exposure; Review; risk assessment; skinfold thickness; systematic review; waist circumference; waist to height ratio"

Previous epidemiological studies suggest association of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, while evidences about the association are inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Twenty-one relevant studies were identified from three databases before 2020. The quality, heterogeneity and possibility of publication bias of included studies were evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, Q-statistic and Begg's test, respectively. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained by means of random-effects meta-analysis models. Meta-analysis results revealed that maternal exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) may have a positive association with preterm birth (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.38). The pooled estimates also showed limited evidence of association between maternal perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure and miscarriage (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.38) with obvious heterogeneity (I2 = 93.9, p &lt; 0.01). However, no such significant associations were found between the other PFASs and miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth. In addition, the subgroup analyses showed that studies on the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and miscarriage were mainly contributed by developed countries. The meta-analysis results indicated maternal exposure to PFOS can increase the risk of preterm birth. The results of the included studies are inconsistent and the effects of PFASs on human health are complex.

The immunotoxicity of these environmental toxicants are well acknowledged and a few studies have focused on the relationship between environmental toxicant exposure and vaccine antibody potency or immunoglobulin (Ig) levels in children. Altered antibody titers or Ig levels in post-vaccination children were correlated with these environmental exposures; however, the effects of environmental toxicants on post-vaccination antibody potency or Ig levels in children have not been summarized. The objectives of this systematic review are therefore 1) to summarize the current studies concerning the associations of early-life exposure to environmental toxicants with vaccine antibody potency or Ig levels in children; and 2) to analyze the possible mechanisms underlying exposure-related alterations of antibody titers or Ig levels against different vaccines. We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature with the key terms and included articles up to September 30, 2020. Based on the eligibility criteria, 28 articles were selected. These studies investigated the associations of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (5 studies), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) (6 studies), other OPs (4 studies), heavy metals (11 studies) and air pollutants, e.g. PM2.5, (3 studies) with the serum-specific antibody concentrations or Ig levels against different vaccines, such as anti-Hib, tetanus, diphtheria toxoid, IgA, IgE, etc. These studies suggest that exposure to these toxicants is generally associated with decreased potency of antibodies produced from childhood immunizations and overall deficiency in vaccines' provided protection. This systematic review provides evidence that exposure-induced changes to humoral immune-related tissue/cells/molecules response to vaccines may play predominant roles in the inverse associations between antibody responsiveness to vaccines and environmental toxicants. This review could thus also help us to conduct better immunization policies for children under environmental toxicant burdens. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Health risks; Heavy metals; Immunization; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Vaccines; Air pollutants; Antibody titers; Child; Children's health; Earliest life; Early-life exposure; Environmental toxicants; Immunoglobulin level; Organics; Systematic Review; Antibodies; diphtheria toxoid; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; perfluoro compound; polychlorinated biphenyl; antibody; child health; concentration (composition); immunization; pollution exposure; toxic material; vaccination; antibody titer; child; environmental exposure; exposure; health hazard; human; humoral immunity; immunoglobulin blood level; immunotoxicity; particulate matter 2.5; pollutant; priority journal; Review; vaccination"

Many studies have reported the association between PFCs exposure with the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, those reports are still debatable, due to their findings. Thus, this review paper aimed to analyse the association of PFCs compound with CVDs and their risk factors in humans by systematic review and meta‐analysis. Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect were searched for PFCs studies on CVDs and their risk from 2009 until present. The association of PFCs exposure with the prevalence of CVDs and their risk factors were assessed by calculating the quality criteria, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). CVDs risk factors were divided into serum lipid profile (main risk factor) and other known risk factors. The meta‐analysis was then used to derive a combined OR test for heterogeneity in findings between studies. Twenty‐nine articles were included. Our meta‐analysis indicated that PFCs exposure could be associated with CVDs (Test for overall effect: z= 2.2, p = 0.02; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 91.6%, CI = 0.92–1.58, p &lt; 0.0001) and their risk factors (Test for overall effect: z= 4.03, p &lt; 0.0001; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 85.8%, CI = 1.00– 1.14, p &lt; 0.0001). In serum lipids, total cholesterol levels are frequently reported associated with the exposure of PFCs. Among PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) exposure increased the risk of CVDs than other types of PFCs. Although the risk of PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with CVDs and their risk factors, more observational studies shall be carried out to identify the long‐term effects of these contaminants in premature CVDs development in patients. © 2021 by the authors.

A series of 16 studies was enrolled in this study. The standard mean difference (SMD) for PFOA-related reproductive toxicity was summarised as −0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, −0.07). The lower serum testosterone levels, decreased absolute testicular and epididymal weights, higher serum estradiol levels, elevated relative testicular and seminal vesicle weights and increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma and percentage of abnormal sperm were observed in the exposed group compared with the control group. However, no statistical difference was found in the day of preputial separation of pups and percentage of motile sperm. In conclusion, PFOA exposure heightens the reproductive system damage in male rodents. However, many studies included in the review did not identify mechanisms by which PFOA induces changes to the male reproductive system, which is an area for additional study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cell proliferation; Mammals; Confidence interval; Pathological changes; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Reproductive organs; Reproductive systems; Reproductive toxicities; Statistical differences; Systematic literature review; Toxicity; estradiol; perfluorooctanoic acid; testosterone; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; bioaccumulation; cell; ecophysiology; organic pollutant; pathology; pollution effect; pollution exposure; rodent; testosterone; drug exposure; estradiol blood level; incidence; male genital system; nonhuman; reproductive toxicity; seminal plasma; seminal vesicle; testosterone blood level; animal; male; meta analysis; reproduction; rodent; Rodentia; Animals; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Male; Reproduction; Rodentia"

They occupy the highest trophic positions in their food chains and are documented to bioaccumulate high concentrations of persistent pollutants such as toxic metals and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs).Whereas raptors played a critical role in developing awareness of and policy for chemical pollution, they have thus far played a much smaller role in current research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Given the critical knowledge obtained from monitoring ‘legacy contaminants’ in raptors, more information on the levels and effects of CECs on raptors is urgently needed. This study critically reviews studies on raptors from Europe reporting the occurrence of CECs with focus on the investigated species, the sampled matrices, and the bioanalytical methods applied. Based on this, we aimed to identify future needs for monitoring CECs in Europe. Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), novel flame retardants (NFRs), and to a lesser extent UV-filters, neonicotinoids, chlorinated paraffins, parabens and bisphenols have been reported in European raptors. White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) were the most frequently studied raptor species. Among matrices, eggs, feathers and plasma were the most widely employed, although the potential role of the preen gland as an excretory organ for CECs has recently been proposed. This review highlights the following research priorities for pollution research on raptors in Europe: 1) studies covering all the main classes of CECs; 2) research in other European regions (mainly East Europe); 3) identification of the most suitable matrices and species for the analysis of different CECs; and 4) the application of alternative sample treatment strategies (e.g. QuEChERS or pressurized liquid extraction) is still limited and conventional solvent-extraction is the preferred choice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Birds; Flame retardants; Solvent extraction; Bioanalytical methods; Chlorinated paraffins; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Environmental pollutions; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Persistent organic pollutants; Pressurized liquid extraction; Research priorities; Organic pollutants; 1,2 bis(2,4,6 tribromophenoxy)ethane; 2 ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5 tetrabromobenzoic acid; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzoic acid; benzyl paraben; bis(2 ethylhexyl) 3,4,5,6 tetrabromo phthalic acid; bisphenol AF; bisphenol F; bisphenol S; bisphenol Z; butyl paraben; decabromodiphenyl ethane; dechlorane; dechlorane plus; flame retardant; long carbon chain paraffin; medium carbon chain paraffin; organofluorine derivative; paraffin; pentylparaben; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; phenol derivative; phenylparaben; phthalic acid; propyl paraben; short carbon chain paraffin; unclassified drug; flame retardant; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); extraction method; flame retardant; persistent organic pollutant; plasma; raptor; solvent; Accipiter gentilis; Belgium; bioaccumulation; blood; body fat; concentration (parameter); egg; Falco peregrinus; falcon; feather; food availability; Haliaeetus albicilla; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver; nonhuman; Norway; peer review; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry; raptor; Review; sediment; solvent extraction; Spain; Sweden; toxicity testing; trend study; trophic level; animal; environmental monitoring; Europe; pollutant; Europe; Accipiter gentilis; Falco peregrinus; Haliaeetus albicilla; Raptores; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Europe; Flame Retardants; Raptors"

POPs are associated with endocrine-disrupting effects including adverse reproductive outcomes that could affect fecundability, i.e. the capacity to conceive a pregnancy, quantified as time to pregnancy (TTP). SEARCH METHODS: We performed an electronic search of literature published between 1 January 2007 and 6 August 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE.com, Global Health, DART/TOXLINE and POPLINE. We included empirical research papers that examined human exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides, brominated flame retardants, polychlorinated organic compounds and/or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome. Standardised forms for screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR software, and all reviews were completed in duplicate. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies. OUTCOMES: The search returned 4573 articles, and 28 papers from 19 different studies met inclusion criteria. Among them, four studies measured TTP prospectively, three had data on participants' prenatal exposure, three examined associations in both male and female partners and one focused exclusively on males. Analyses varied widely in terms of exposure characterisation, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Evidence was strongest for adverse associations of female exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls with TTP, with some additional support for associations of female exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and PFAS with longer TTP. Our review provided little or no support for associations between female exposure to OC pesticides or male exposure to any of the POP groups and TTP. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggests that female exposure to at least some POPs may reduce fecundability. Although many of these chemicals are no longer in production, they are still detectable in human biosamples because of their persistence in the environment. Replacement chemicals that are being introduced as older ones are restricted may have similar reproductive consequences. Future studies should examine these newer POPs, assess interactions between POPs and other chemical and non-chemical exposures, investigate how POPs are distributed in and metabolised by the human body and focus on populations that may be disproportionately exposed. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

Many communities have had water contaminated by PFAS, and cancer is one of the important community concerns related to PFAS exposure. Objectives: We critically reviewed the evidence relating to PFAS and cancer from an epidemiologic standpoint to highlight directions for future research that would be the most likely to meaningfully increase knowledge. Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed for studies of cancer and PFAS (through 9/20/2020). We identified epidemiologic studies that provided a quantitative estimate for some measure of the association between PFAS and cancer. Here, we review that literature, including several aspects of epidemiologic study design that impact the usefulness of study results. Results: We identified 16 cohort (or case-cohort) studies, 10 case-control studies (4 nested within cohorts and 6 non-nested), 1 cross sectional study and 1 ecologic study. The cancer sites with the most evidence of an association with PFAS are testicular and kidney cancer. There are also some suggestions in a few studies of an association with prostate cancer, but the data are inconsistent. Discussion: Each study's design has strengths and limitations. Weaknesses in study design and methods can, in some cases, lead to questionable associations, but in other cases can make it more difficult to detect true associations, if they are present. Overall, the evidence for an association between cancer and PFAS remains sparse. A variety of studies with different strengths and weaknesses can be helpful to clarify associations between PFAS and cancer. Long term follow-up of large-sized cohorts with large exposure contrasts are most likely to be informative. © 2021","perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; water; adult; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer localization; case control study; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; human; kidney cancer; male; malignant neoplasm; Medline; priority journal; prostate cancer; quantitative analysis; Review; systematic review; testis cancer; kidney tumor; pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Water"

In addition to other factors such as smoking, air pollution and atopy, some environmental chemicals are shown or suspected to increase the risk of asthma, exacerbate asthma symptoms and cause other respiratory symptoms. In this scoping review, we report environmental chemicals, prioritized for investigation in the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU), which are associated or possibly associated with asthma. The substance groups con-sidered to cause asthma through specific sensitization include: diisocyanates, hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) and possibly p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA). In epidemiological studies, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organophosphate insecticides are associated with asthma, and phthalates, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), pyrethroid insecticides, mercury, cad-mium, arsenic and lead are only potentially associated with asthma. As a conclusion, exposure to PAHs and some pesticides are associated with increased risk of asthma. Diisocyanates and Cr(VI) cause asthma with specific sensitization. For many environmental chemicals, current studies have provided contradicting results in relation to increased risk of asthma. Therefore, more research about exposure to environmental chemicals and risk of asthma is needed. © 2021 by the authors.

The immunotoxicity of EDCs involves many mechanisms altering gene expression that depend on the activation of nuclear receptors such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which also results in skin and intestinal disorders, microbiota alterations and inflammatory diseases. This systematic review aims to review different mechanisms of immunotoxicity and immunomodulation of T cells, focusing on T regulatory (Treg) and Th17 subsets, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) caused by specific EDCs such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), bisphenols (BPs) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). To achieve this objective, a systematic study was conducted searching various databases including PubMed and Scopus to find in-vitro, in-vivo, and biomonitoring studies that examine EDC-dependent mechanisms of immunotoxicity. While doing the systematic review, we found species- and cell-specific outcomes and a translational gap between in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Finally, an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is proposed, which explains mechanistically toxicity endpoints emerging from different EDCs having similar key events and can help to improve our understanding of EDCs mechanisms of immunotoxicity. In conclusion, this review provides insights into the mechanisms of immunotoxicity mediated by EDCs and will help to improve human health risk assessment. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; endocrine disruptor; estrogen receptor; gamma interferon; heat shock protein 90; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 17; protein bcl 6; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor FOXP3; transforming growth factor beta; endocrine disruptor; estrogen receptor; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; adverse outcome pathway; antigen presenting cell; apoptosis; B lymphocyte; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell differentiation; cell survival; dendritic cell; dosimetry; down regulation; gene expression; health hazard; homeostasis; human; immunocompetent cell; immunomodulation; immunotoxicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; outcome assessment; quantitative structure activity relation; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; systematic review; T lymphocyte; Th17 cell; upregulation; immune system; Endocrine Disruptors; Humans; Immune System; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Receptors, Estrogen"

In addition, previous dose-response assessments have focused primarily on evidence from animal studies. This critical review summarizes peer reviewed epidemiological studies on PFOA and cancers of the kidneys and testes, using modified Hill’s criteria to assess the evidence for causation. We converted exposures to a common scale based on serum PFOA concentrations and applied meta-analysis to estimate the average increase in cancer risk reported by the studies with sufficient information to estimate serum PFOA. Using random effects meta-analysis, we found that the average relative increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL increase in serum PFOA for these studies is 16% (95% CI: 3%, 30%) for kidney cancer and 3% (95% CI: 2%, 4%) for testicular cancer. These associations are most likely causal, but results are limited by the small number of studies for testicular cancer, the overlapping study populations for several studies, and the lack of measured or modeled serum PFOA concentrations for several studies. Implications: Our review meta-analysis indicates an average increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL increase in serum PFOA for kidney and testicular cancers. These associations are most likely causal, but results are limited by the small number of studies for testicular cancer, the overlapping study populations for several studies, and the lack of measured or modeled serum PFOA concentrations for several studies.

This review summarizes the underlying evidence on the primary fate and in vitro/vivo toxic effects of PFCs and their interactions and relationships with thyroid dysfunction and cancer induction in exposed groups, including the general population, occupationally exposed groups, highly exposed individuals, and prone subjects (pregnant women and neonates). The potential endocrine-disrupting mechanism of PFCs may include multiple processes of thyroid malfunction or hormonal imbalance. The increased level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed as the most consistent outcome of PFC exposure among generally exposed populations. Specifically, the levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and TSH were significantly correlated among pregnant women. In some instances, the maternal PFC level was negatively correlated with the neonatal thyroxine (T4) level in serum. The PFCs and thyroid malfunction or thyroid hormone (TH) levels also revealed a potential association among the population under high-level environmental exposure, albeit not always following a strict exposure-response relationship. Moreover, occupational exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) showed a probable link with TH (excluding TSH) alterations in serum. Importantly, no concrete and statistically significant evidence highlighted the risk of thyroid cancer in humans exposed to PFCs. Highlights The first robust review describing the effects of PFCs on thyroid dysfunctions. PFC exposure induces sex- and age-specific responses in the human thyroid system. Serum PFOS exposure is positively correlated with TSH in pregnant women. Maternal serum PFC levels are negatively correlated with the neonate’s T4 levels.

Mortality is associated mainly with the development of metastases. Identification of the mechanisms involved in metastasis formation is, therefore, a major public health issue. Among the proposed risk factors, chemical environment and pollution are increasingly suggested to have an effect on the signaling pathways involved in metastatic tumor cells emergence and progression. The purpose of this article is to summarize current knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals in breast cancer progression, metastasis formation and resistance to chemotherapy. Through a scoping review, we highlight the effects of a wide variety of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disruptors, on invasion mechanisms and metastatic processes in BC. We identified the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer-stemness (the stem cell-like phenotype in tumors), two mechanisms suspected of playing key roles in the development of metastases and linked to chemoresistance, as potential targets of contaminants. We discuss then the recently described pro-migratory and pro-invasive Ah receptor signaling pathway and conclude that his role in BC progression is still controversial. In conclusion, although several pertinent pathways for the effects of xenobiotics have been identified, the mechanisms of actions for multiple other molecules remain to be established. The integral role of xenobiotics in the exposome in BC needs to be further explored through additional relevant epidemiological studies that can be extended to molecular mechanisms. © 2020, The Author(s).","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2 amino 1 methyl 6 phenylimidazo[4,5 b]pyridine; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene; alcohol; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; arsenic; benzophenone; benzo[a]pyrene; cadmium; chlorphenotane; chromium; cigarette smoke; environmental chemical; hexachlorobenzene; nickel; nonylphenol; organochlorine pesticide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; tungsten; biological development; cancer; drug resistance; emergence; mortality; phenotype; public health; xenobiotics; breast cancer; cancer growth; cancer stem cell; carcinogenicity; drug resistance; environmental exposure; environmental health; epithelial mesenchymal transition; human; metastasis; nonhuman; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; Review; risk factor; systematic review; animal; breast tumor; disease exacerbation; female; pathology; pollutant; toxicity; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Disease Progression; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans"

The Panel determined in 2012 there was a ‘probable link’ (i.e., more probable than not based on the weight of the available scientific evidence) between PFOA and high cholesterol, thyroid disease, kidney and testicular cancer, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. Objective: Here, former C8 Science Panel members and collaborators comment on the PFOA literature regarding thyroid disorders, cancer, immune and auto-immune disorders, liver disease, hypercholesterolemia, reproductive outcomes, neurotoxicity, and kidney disease. We also discuss developments regarding fate and transport, and pharmacokinetic models, and discuss causality assessment in cross-sectional associations among low-exposed populations. Discussion: For cancer, the epidemiologic evidence remains supportive but not definitive for kidney and testicular cancers. There is consistent evidence of a positive association between PFOA and cholesterol, but no evidence of an association with heart disease. There is evidence for an association with ulcerative colitis, but not for other auto-immune diseases. There is good evidence that PFOA is associated with immune response, but uneven evidence for an association with infectious disease. The evidence for an association between PFOA and thyroid and kidney disease is suggestive but uneven. There is evidence of an association with liver enzymes, but not with liver disease. There is little evidence of an association with neurotoxicity. Suggested reductions in birthweight may be due to reverse causality and/or confounding. Fate and transport models and pharmacokinetic models remain central to estimating past exposure for new cohorts, but are difficult to develop without good historical data on emissions of PFOA into the environment. Conclusion: Overall, the epidemiologic evidence remains limited. For a few outcomes there has been some replication of our earlier findings. More longitudinal research is needed in large populations with large exposure contrasts. Additional cross-sectional studies of low exposed populations may be less informative. © 2020","Cholesterol; Pharmacokinetics; Cross-sectional study; Fate and transport; Hypercholesterolemia; Longitudinal research; Pharmacokinetic model; Pregnancy-induced hypertensions; Scientific evidence; Ulcerative colitis; Diseases; cholesterol; liver enzyme; octanoic acid derivative; perfluoroctanoate; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; environmental fate; enzyme; health impact; immune response; infectious disease; pollutant transport; public health; autoimmune disease; birth weight; cancer risk; environmental exposure; environmental health; genital system disease; health hazard; human; hypercholesterolemia; immune response; immunotoxicity; kidney cancer; liver disease; maternal hypertension; neurotoxicity; Ohio; population research; population size; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; testis cancer; thyroid disease; toxicokinetics; ulcerative colitis; cross-sectional study; female; male; pregnancy; testis tumor; Caprylates; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Male; Ohio; Pregnancy; Testicular Neoplasms"

Although exposure to PFASs may contribute to the development of allergic diseases in children, evidence about this association remains inconclusive. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between PFASs exposure and allergic diseases in children based on current evidence. Methods: The databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to identify all observational studies that examined the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of childhood allergic diseases. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of case-crossover studies, and a previously validated quality assessment framework was used for observational studies lacking control groups. Random-effects meta-analysis models were applied to pool odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: From an initial 94 articles (after duplicate removal), 13 studies through full-text assessment were included for quantitative assessment and descriptive synthesis. They are ten cohort studies, two cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study. The pooled estimates showed that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was associated with eczema (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80–0.99), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) with atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01–1.58), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) with allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.13–1.56). However, no such significant associations were found for wheeze and asthma. Conclusions: The meta-analysis results suggest that PFASs exposure could potentially be associated with eczema, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis during childhood, but not with childhood asthma or wheeze. Future studies are needed to verify these findings. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; allergy; asthma; child health; confidence interval; meta-analysis; model validation; pollution exposure; software; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; childhood; disease association; eczema; human; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; systematic review; wheezing; case control study; child; cross-sectional study; female; meta analysis; pollutant; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; toxicity; Case-Control Studies; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"

Consumption of PFAS-contaminated agricultural products represents a feasible pathway for the trophic transfer of these toxic chemicals along food chains/webs, leading to risks associated with human and animal health. Recently, studies on plant uptake and accumulation of PFASs have rapidly increased; consequently, a review to summarize the current knowledge and highlight future research is needed. Analysis of the publications indicates that a large variety of plant species can take up PFASs from the environment. Vegetables and grains are the most commonly investigated crops, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as the most studied PFASs. The potential sources of PFASs for plant uptake include industrial emissions, irrigation with contaminated water, land application of biosolids, leachates from landfill sites, and pesticide application. Root uptake is the predominant pathway for the accumulation of PFASs in agricultural crops, and uptake by plant aboveground portions from the ambient atmosphere could play a minor role in the overall PFAS accumulation. PFAS uptake by plants is influenced by physicochemical properties of compounds (e.g., perfluorocarbon chain length, head group functionality, water solubility, and volatility), plant physiology (e.g., transpiration rate, lipid and protein content), and abiotic factors (e.g., soil organic matters, pH, salinity, and temperature). Based on literature analysis, the current knowledge gaps are identified, and future research prospects are suggested. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Crops; Health risks; Industrial emissions; Leachate treatment; Physicochemical properties; Veterinary medicine; Water pollution; Literature analysis; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Persistent organic contaminants; Pesticide applications; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Soil organic matters; Transpiration rates; Uptake and accumulations; Chemical contamination; alkyl group; organic compound; per and polyfluoroalkyl substance; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; soil organic matter; unclassified drug; water; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; biological uptake; biosolid; landfill; leachate; organic pollutant; pesticide; pesticide residue; protein; toxicity; transpiration; Article; atmosphere; biosolid; crop; food chain; grain; landfill; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; plant; plant physiology; protein content; publication; salinity; solubility; temperature; vegetable; water contamination; agriculture; animal; chemistry; human; metabolism; plant; soil; soil pollutant; Animalia; Agriculture; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Caprylates; Crops, Agricultural; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Plants; Soil; Soil Pollutants"

We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature conducted up to September 18, 2019 with some key terms. From the initial 155 articles, 15 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and consist of highly heterogeneous research methods. Seven studies assessed the effects of multiple environmental pollutants (metals, organic pollutants, nicotine, air pollutants) on the maternal urine and blood metabolomic profile; five studies evaluated the effects of arsenic, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nicotine, and ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on the cord blood metabolomic profile; and one study assessed the effects of smoking exposure on the amniotic fluid metabolomic profile. The alteration of metabolic pathways in these studies mainly involve energy metabolism, hormone metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. No population study investigated the association between environmental toxicants and placental metabolomics. This systematic review provides evidence that prenatal exposure to a variety of environmental pollutants can affect maternal and fetal metabolomic characteristics. Integration of environmental toxicant exposure and metabolomics data in maternal-fetal samples is helpful to understand the interaction between toxicants and metabolites, so as to reveal the pathogenesis of fetal disease or diseases of fetal origin. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air; Blood; Health risks; Metabolism; Metabolites; Nicotine; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Electronic database; Environmental pollutants; Environmental toxicants; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Inclusion and exclusions; Metabolic pathways; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Population studies; Organic pollutants; arsenic; biological marker; environmental chemical; nicotine; polychlorinated biphenyl; biological marker; biomarker; health risk; maternal health; metabolism; neonate; pollution exposure; smoking; toxicity; air pollutant; amino acid metabolism; amnion fluid; Article; blood analysis; energy metabolism; environmental exposure; health hazard; human; lipid metabolism; metabolite; metabolomics; mother fetus relationship; nucleic acid metabolism; oxidative stress; particulate matter; prenatal exposure; priority journal; systematic review; urinalysis; dangerous goods; environmental exposure; female; fetus; maternal exposure; maternal welfare; metabolomics; pregnancy; Biomarkers; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fetus; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Maternal Health; Metabolomics; Pregnancy"

This paper synthesises literature about the status of the pollutants and their precursors, identifies knowledge gaps and discusses future perspectives on the study of PFASs in Africa. Limited data on PFASs prevalence in Africa is available because there is limited capacity to monitor PFASs in African laboratories. The levels of PFASs in Africa are higher in samples from urban and industrialized areas compared to rural areas. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are the dominant PFASs in human samples from Africa. Levels of PFOS and PFOA in these samples are lower than or comparable to those from industrialized countries. PFOA and PFOS levels in drinking water in Africa are, in some cases, higher than the EPA drinking water guidelines suggesting potential risk to humans. The levels of PFASs in birds' eggs from South Africa are higher, while those in other environmental media from Africa are lower or comparable to those from industrialized countries. Diet influences the pollutant levels in fish, while size and sex affect their accumulation in crocodiles. No bioaccumulation of PFASs in aquatic systems in Africa could be confirmed due to small sample sizes. Reported sources of PFASs in Africa include municipal landfills, inefficient wastewater treatment plants, consumer products containing PFASs, industrial wastewater and urban runoff. Relevant stakeholders need to take serious action to identify and deal with the salient sources of PFASs on the African continent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biochemistry; Consumer products; Environmental Protection Agency; Organic pollutants; Potable water; Sewage; Wastewater treatment; Adverse health effects; Environmental levels; Industrial wastewaters; Industrialized countries; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Wastewater treatment plants; Industrial water treatment; drinking water; organic compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; bioaccumulation; critical analysis; drinking water; landfill; organic pollutant; organofluorine; pollution monitoring; wastewater treatment plant; Africa; ambient air; aquatic environment; body burden; developed country; diet; environmental monitoring; fish; human; nonhuman; pollutant; prevalence; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; rural area; sediment; sludge; urban area; urban rural difference; waste management; wildlife; animal; body burden; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; pollutant; South Africa; waste water; water pollutant; South Africa; Aves; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles); Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Body Burden; Caprylates; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; South Africa; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Another possibility may be that most BC studies are skewed towards individuals at average risk, which may limit the ability to detect signals from ECE. Objectives: We reviewed the literature on ECE and BC focusing on three types of studies or subgroup analyses based on higher absolute BC risk: BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC (Type 2); and/or genetic susceptibility (Type 3). Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database to identify epidemiologic studies examining ECE and BC risk published through June 1, 2019. Results: We identified 100 publications in 56 unique epidemiologic studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6%) were enriched with BC family history and only 11% of studies (6/56) were specifically enriched with early onset cases. 80% of the publications from these 8 enriched studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications) supported a statistically significant association between ECE and BC risk including studies of PAH, indoor cooking, NO2, DDT; PCBs, PFOSA; metals; personal care products; and occupational exposure to industrial dyes. 74% of Type 3 publications (20/27) supported statistically significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air pollution, PCBs, phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater genetic susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes. Discussion: Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family history, younger age of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently support an association between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to measuring exposures during WOS, designing studies that are enriched with women at higher absolute risk are necessary to robustly measure the role of ECE on BC risk. © 2020 The Authors","cancer; carcinogen; epidemiology; gene expression; health risk; literature review; pollution exposure; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; breast tumor; cooking; environmental exposure; female; human; Breast Neoplasms; Cooking; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"

The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. Results A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent. Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A and overweight (OR 1.254, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.273 to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1018 to 3.184). Conclusion Most observational studies supported a positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs.

Aim: To systematically review the literature and perform a quantitative synthesis to evaluate the effect of EDs on testicular function. Materials and methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in the MEDLINE, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases. Eligible for the systematic review were observational (cross-sectional and cohort) studies with (i) adult men who had a high probability of postnatal exposure to EDs (“exposed”), (ii) adult men who had a low probability of postnatal exposure to EDs (“non-exposed”), and (iii) an outcome of interest [seminal parameters and reproductive hormone concentrations].

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between early life exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and ADHD in a collaborative study including nine European population-based studies, encompassing 4,826 mother–child pairs. METHODS: Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were measured in maternal serum/plasma during pregnancy, or in breast milk, with different timing of sample collection in each cohort. We used a validated pharmacokinetic model of pregnancy and lactation to estimate concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in children at birth and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of age. We classified ADHD using recommended cutoff points for each instrument used to derive symptoms scores. We used multiple imputation for missing covariates, logistic regression to model the association between PFAS exposure and ADHD in each study, and combined all adjusted study-specific effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 399 children were classified as having ADHD, with a prevalence ranging from 2.3% to 7.3% in the studies. Early life exposure to PFOS or PFOA was not associated with ADHD during childhood [odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.06) to 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.11)]. Results from stratified models suggest potential differential effects of PFAS related to child sex and maternal education. CONCLUSION: We did not identify an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with early life exposure to PFOS and PFOA. However, stratified analyses suggest that there may be an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with PFAS exposure in girls, in children from nulliparous women, and in children from low-educated mothers, all of which warrant further exploration. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5444. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The etiology of T1D is not fully understood but it seems multifactorial. The genetic background determines the predisposition to develop T1D, while the autoimmune process against β-cells seems to be also determined by environmental triggers, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Environmental EDCs may act throughout different temporal windows as single chemical agent or as chemical mixtures. They could affect the development and the function of the immune system or of the β-cells function, promoting autoimmunity and increasing the susceptibility to autoimmune attack. Human studies evaluating the potential role of exposure to EDCs on the pathogenesis of T1D are few and demonstrated contradictory results. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize experimental and epidemiological studies on the potential role of exposure to EDCs in the development of T1D.

These changes are linked to anogenital distance (AGD), which is an androgen-sensitive anthropometric parameter used as a biomarker of perineal growth and caudal migration of the genital tubercle. This review aimed to summarize strength of evidence for associations of in utero exposure to EDCs with AGD and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature so as to inform future research. We performed an electronic search of English literature in September 2019 in medical literature analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE), Web of Science and Toxline. We included epidemiological studies that examined in utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent EDCs and considered AGD in offspring as an outcome. Our review contained 16 investigations examining exposure to persistent EDCs (nine studies) and nonpersistent EDCs (seven studies). Some individual studies reported an inverse association between exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins, perfluoroalkyl substances, and organochlorides and AGD in both male and female offspring. Meta-analysis of three studies found a small reduction of AGD in female offspring exposed to BPA. The number of studies per chemical is small, and number of subjects examined is limited; so, replication of these results is needed. To achieve more specificity and better replication of results, future studies should establish the association of nonpersistent EDCs using multiple urine samples, evaluate the cumulative impact of exposure to a mixture of anti-androgenic chemicals, and offer adequate consideration of more maternal- and children-related confounding factors. © 2019 The Author(s).

Several PFAS have been identified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals based on their ability to interfere with normal reproductive function and hormonal signalling. Experimental models and epidemiologic studies suggest that PFAS exposures target the ovary and represent major risks for women's health. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This review summarises human population and toxicological studies on the association between PFAS exposure and ovarian function. SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive review was performed by searching PubMed. Search terms included an extensive list of PFAS and health terms ranging from general keywords (e.g. ovarian, reproductive, follicle, oocyte) to specific keywords (including menarche, menstrual cycle, menopause, primary ovarian insufficiency/premature ovarian failure, steroid hormones), based on the authors' knowledge of the topic and key terms. OUTCOMES: Clinical evidence demonstrates the presence of PFAS in follicular fluid and their ability to pass through the blood-follicle barrier. Although some studies found no evidence associating PFAS exposure with disruption in ovarian function, numerous epidemiologic studies, mostly with cross-sectional study designs, have identified associations of higher PFAS exposure with later menarche, irregular menstrual cycles, longer cycle length, earlier age of menopause and reduced levels of oestrogens and androgens. Adverse effects of PFAS on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis have been confirmed in experimental models. Based on laboratory research findings, PFAS could diminish ovarian reserve and reduce endogenous hormone synthesis through activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, disrupting gap junction intercellular communication between oocyte and granulosa cells, inducing thyroid hormone deficiency, antagonising ovarian enzyme activities involved in ovarian steroidogenesis or inhibiting kisspeptin signalling in the hypothalamus. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The published literature supports associations between PFAS exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes; however, the evidence remains insufficient to infer a causal relationship between PFAS exposure and ovarian disorders. Thus, more research is warranted. PFAS are of significant concern because these chemicals are ubiquitous and persistent in the environment and in humans. Moreover, susceptible groups, such as foetuses and pregnant women, may be exposed to harmful combinations of chemicals that include PFAS. However, the role environmental exposures play in reproductive disorders has received little attention by the medical community. To better understand the potential risk of PFAS on human ovarian function, additional experimental studies using PFAS doses equivalent to the exposure levels found in the general human population and mixtures of compounds are required. Prospective investigations in human populations are also warranted to ensure the temporality of PFAS exposure and health endpoints and to minimise the possibility of reverse causality. © The Author(s) 2020.

Big efforts are continuously made to monitor their levels and identify safe thresholds. For this purpose, an essential step is to prioritize harmful substances and understand their effect on human body. Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) deserve particular attention because of their wide diffusion and potential correlation with different diseases including glucose intolerance, hyperlipidaemia, thyroid diseases, gestational diabetes mellitus and hypertension, testicular and genitourinary cancer as well as impaired kidney function. This review focuses on the renal effects of PFCs, with the attempt to clarify their occurrence and pathogenetic mechanisms.Recent findingsWe reviewed MEDLINE and EMBASE citations between 31 October 2017 and 31 May 2019 and selected human studies measuring PFCs exposure, kidney function markers and the ability of haemodialysis to remove PFCs from the circulating blood. It has been currently clarified that exposure to PFCs is linked with an impaired kidney function and that they can be removed by blood purification.SummaryFurther studies are required on the potential synergic negative effect of PFCs co-exposure with other pollutants as well as animal studies about the removal capacity of different haemodialysis membranes.

Two of them, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are the most known and well investigated. As for many other organic substances that are of environmental concern, the diet is the main route of human exposure to PFAS. However, in certain cases drinking water may also mean a significant contribution to human exposure, and to a lesser extent, dust and air (indoor exposure). In recent years, the environmental persistence of PFAS, their biomagnification in food webs, as well as their potential accumulation and toxicity, have generated a notable interest, which has been evidenced by the considerable number of publications in this regard. Recently, we carried out a wide revision on the levels of PFAS in food and human dietary intake. In the current review, we have summarized the recent information (last 10 years) published in the scientific literature (Scopus and PubMed) on the concentrations of PFAS in drinking water and the human health risks derived from the regular water consumption, when available. A large amount of data belongs to PFOS and PFOA and corresponds to studies mainly conducted in countries of the European Union, USA and China, although no information is available for most countries over the world. According to the toxicological information about PFAS that is so far available, the current health risks for the regular consumers of municipal/tap water do not seem to be of concern according to the levels considered as acceptable for various regulatory institutions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","drinking water; fluorocarbon; dietary exposure; human; water pollutant; Dietary Exposure; Drinking Water; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females, as Cmale/Cfemale (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding ecology may be more important. Interspecies variation in maternal pollutant transfer may lead to negative effects scaling from an offspring to population level. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Mercury (metal); Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Proteins; Anthropogenic pollutants; Incubation periods; Interspecies variation; Lipophilic pollutants; Pollutant concentration; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Sex-specific differences; Investments; mercury; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; anthropogenic source; chemical compound; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); egg production; egg size; feeding ecology; meta-analysis; PCB; pollution effect; seabird; Article; clutch size; concentration ratio; egg production; feeding ecology; incubation time; investment; meta analysis; nonhuman; progeny; seabird; sex difference; egg; female; human; male; ovum; pollutant; reproduction; Aves; Eggs; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Male; Ovum; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Reproduction"

This has led to the gradual phase-out from production and commerce of some legacy PFAS. Fluoroalkylether compounds (ether-PFAS) are among the fluorinated alternative chemicals that are beginning to be reported in impacted and background environments. Extensive monitoring activities were conducted since 2015–2019 to bridge knowledge gaps on the environmental fate and effects of ether-PFAS including F-53B (6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate [6:2 Cl-PFAES] and 8:2 Cl-PFAES), Gen-X (hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid [HFPO-DA]), and ADONA (dodecafluoro-3H-4,8-dioxanonanoate). In recent years, advances in nontarget screening using high-resolution mass spectrometry have revealed the identities of other infrequently monitored ether-PFAS. In this critical review, we provide an up-to-date inventory of the structures of ether-PFAS discovered in the recent literature. Their environmental occurrence, fate, and effects are discussed on a comparative perspective with some legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Information on the methods employed for the quantitative and semi-quantitative analysis of ether-PFAS is also provided, including sample preparation and mass spectrometry analysis, analytical performance, and limitations. In particular, the compiled database of MS/MS fragment ions (n = 111) can be useful in spectrum interpretation of novel ether-PFAS.

Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA's maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution. © 2019 Elsevier LtdWe surveyed literature on 65 batoids species and found a large range of reported inorganic and organic contaminants at levels below food safety limits, except for Hg, As and PCB. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical contamination; Contamination; Ecosystems; Insecticides; Marine pollution; Mercury (metal); Metals; Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Tissue; Trace elements; Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; Elasmobranch; Inorganic contaminants; Organochlorines; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB); Organic pollutants; alkyl group; arsenic acid; bismuth; cadmium; chlordane; chlorphenotane; chromium; cobalt; copper; dieldrin; heptachlor epoxide; hexachlorobenzene; iron; lead; manganese; mercury; nickel; palladium; perfluoro compound; platinum; polychlorinated biphenyl; rhodium; rubidium; selenium; strontium; tin; trace metal; unindexed drug; vanadium; zinc; chlorinated hydrocarbon; environmental marker; heavy metal; trace element; bioindicator; chemical pollutant; literature review; marine pollution; mercury (element); organochlorine; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; shark; teleost; trace metal; bioaccumulation; cartilaginous fish; concentration (parameter); egg; egg yolk; environmental exposure; fin (organ); foraging; geographical variation (species); gill; health hazard; intestine tissue; kidney tissue; liver tissue; muscle; nonhuman; ovum; persistent organic pollutant; pollution transport; population exposure; Review; systematic review; tissue level; water contamination; analysis; animal; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; metabolism; procedures; skate (fish); water pollutant; Batoidea; Chondrichthyes; Dasyatidae; Rhinobatidae; Teleostei; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Biomarkers; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Metals, Heavy; Skates (Fish); Trace Elements; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The transition to short-chain fluorotelomer-based products as a cornerstone in replacement fluorochemistry has raised questions regarding potential human health risks associated with exposure to fluorotelomer-based substances and therefore, PFHxA. Here, we present a critical review of data relevant to such a risk assessment, including epidemiological studies and in vivo and in vitro toxicity studies that examined PFHxA acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity. Key findings from toxicokinetic and mode-of-action studies are also evaluated. Sufficient data exist to conclude that PFHxA is not carcinogenic, is not a selective reproductive or developmental toxicant, and does not disrupt endocrine activity. Collectively, effects caused by PFHxA exposure are largely limited to potential kidney effects, are mild and/or reversible, and occur at much higher doses than observed for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A chronic human-health-based oral reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day was calculated using benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis from a chronic rat bioassay. This RfD is four orders of magnitude greater than the chronic oral RfD calculated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for PFOA. The PFHxA RfD can be used to inform public health decisions related to PFHxA and fluorotelomer precursors for which PFHxA is a terminal degradant. These findings clearly demonstrate that PFHxA is less hazardous to human health than PFOA.

With the shift towards short-chain PFAA chemistry, uncertainties remain regarding human health risks associated with current exposure levels. Here, we present a critical review and assessment of data relevant to human health risk assessment to today's short-chain PFAA chemistry. Human biomonitoring surveys indicate that PFHxA is infrequently detected in the environment as well as in human serum and urine; however, human health concerns may persist in locations where PFHxA is detected. In a companion paper (Luz et al., 2019) we comprehensively evaluate the available toxicity data for PFHxA, and derive a chronic human health-based reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day based on benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis in chronically exposed female rats. In this paper, we apply this RfD in human health-based screening levels calculations, and derive a drinking water lifetime health advisory of 1400 μg/L and a residential groundwater screening level for children of 4000 μg/L. Compared to environmental concentration data, even sites with more elevated concentrations of PFHxA in the environment are at least an order of magnitude lower than these screening levels. Available PFHxA human serum and urine biomonitoring data, used as a biomarker for general population exposure, demonstrates that the general human population exposures to PFHxA are low. Previous estimates of daily intake rates for infants exposed to PFHxA through breast milk, formula, and baby foods (Lorenzo et al., 2016) combined with the most conservative PFHxA peer-reviewed toxicity value (Luz et al., 2019) demonstrate that the margin of safety for PFHxA is high. Therefore, PFHxA and related fluorotelomer precursors currently appear to present negligible human health risk to the general population and are not likely to drive or substantially contribute to risk at sites contaminated with PFAS mixtures. PFHxA may also represent a suitable marker for the safety of fluorotelomer replacement chemistry used today. © 2019","drinking water; ground water; perfluorohexanoic acid; biological marker; fluorocarbon; hexanoic acid derivative; perfluorohexanoic acid; animal experiment; animal model; Article; artificial milk; baby food; benchmarking; biological monitoring; blood analysis; breast milk; child; controlled study; female; health hazard; health survey; human; kidney papilla necrosis; male; newborn; nonhuman; peer review; population exposure; preschool child; priority journal; rat; residential area; risk assessment; screening test; toxicity; urinalysis; analysis; water pollutant; Biomarkers; Caproates; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

This review aims to evaluate the impact of environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals [phthalates, parabens, triclosan, bisphenol A (BPA), organochlorine (PCBs) and perfluorinated (PFCs) compounds] on the reproductive potential among women, by reviewing most recently published literature. Epidemiological studies focusing on EDCs exposure and reproductive potential among women for the last 16 years were identified by a search of the PUBMED, MEDLINE, EBSCO and TOXNET literature databases. The results of the presented studies show that exposure to EDCs impacts the reproductive potential in women, measured by ovarian reserve and by assisted reproductive technology outcomes. Exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals decrease: (i) oestradiol levels (BPA); (ii) anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations (PCBs); (iii) antral follicle count (BPA, parabens, phthalates); (iv) oocyte quality (BPA, triclosan, phthalates, PCBs); (v) fertilization rate (PFCs, PCBs); (vi) implantation (BPA, phthalates, PCBs); (vii) embryo quality (triclosan, PCBs, BPA); (viii) rate of clinical pregnancy and live births (parabens, phthalates). The studies were mostly well-designed and used prospective cohorts with the exposure assessment based on the biomarker of exposure. Considering the suggested health effects, more epidemiological data is urgently needed to confirm the presented findings. © 2017, © 2017 The British Fertility Society.","4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; endocrine disruptor; estradiol; Muellerian inhibiting factor; organochlorine derivative; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; triclosan; endocrine disruptor; antral follicle count; environmental exposure; female; female fertility; female infertility; hormone determination; human; in vitro fertilization; nidation; oocyte; ovarian reserve; pregnancy; reproductive health; Review; adult; female infertility; pollutant; toxicity; Adult; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Infertility, Female"

To disentangle further the complex interplay between the socio-exposome and internal chemical exposure, we performed a meta-analysis of human biomonitoring (HBM) studies with internal exposure data on per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and detailed information on risk factors, including descriptors of socio-economic status (SES) of the study population. PFASs are persistent in nature, and some have endocrine-disrupting properties. Individual studies have shown that HBM biomarker concentrations of PFASs generally increase with SES indicators, e.g., for income. Based on a meta-analysis (five studies) of the associations between PFASs and SES indicators, the magnitude of the association could be estimated. For the SES indicator income, changes in income were expressed by a factor change, which was corrected by the Gini coefficient to take into account the differences in income categories between studies, and the income range between countries. For the SES indicator education, we had to conclude that descriptors (<college, x years of study, etc.) differed too widely between studies to perform a meta-analysis. Therefore, the use of the uniform ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) is recommended in future studies. The meta-analysis showed that a higher income is associated with a higher internal exposure to PFASs (PFOS or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, PFOA or perfluorooctanoic acid, PFNA or perfluorononanoic acid, PFHxS or perfluorohexane sulfonate). This is opposite to the environmental justice hypothesis, referring to an inequitable distribution of detrimental environmental effects toward poor and minority communities by a practice or policy. With a doubling of the income, internal exposure increased on average by 10%–14%. Possible explanations for this difference are given, e.g., underlying differences in diet. However, other sources can also contribute, and the exact causes of SES-related differences in PFAS concentrations remain unclear. Studies are needed that include social descriptors together with lifestyle and dietary information as explanatory variables for internal chemical exposure levels. This will help clarify the underlying factors that link SES with inequity to environmental exposures, and will raise awareness and knowledge to strengthen the capacities of people and communities to advocate chemical exposure reduction in order to reduce this health inequity. © 2018 by the authors.

Despite increasing awareness as global pollutants, the impact of PFAS exposure on human health is not well understood, and there are growing concerns for adverse effects on kidney function. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to summarize and identify gaps in the understanding between PFAS exposure and kidney health. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Global Health, World Health Organization Global Index, and Web of Science for studies published from 1990 to 2018. We included studies on the epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, or toxicology of PFAS exposure and kidney-related health, including clinical, histologic, molecular, and metabolic outcomes related to kidney disease, or outcomes related to the pharmacokinetic role of the kidneys. Results We identified 74 studies, including 21 epidemiologic, 13 pharmacokinetic, and 40 toxicological studies. Three population-based epidemiologic studies demonstrated associations between PFAS exposure and lower kidney function. Along with toxicology studies (n=10) showing tubular histologic and cellular changes from PFAS exposure, pharmacokinetic studies (n=5) demonstrated the kidneys were major routes of elimination, with active proximal tubule transport. In several studies (n=17), PFAS exposure altered several pathways linked to kidney disease, including oxidative stress pathways, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor pathways, NF-E2– related factor 2 pathways, partial epithelial mesenchymal transition, and enhanced endothelial permeability through actin filament modeling. Conclusions A growing body of evidence portends PFASs are emerging environmental threats to kidney health; yet several important gaps in our understanding still exist. © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.","antioxidant; creatinine; environmental chemical; organic anion transporter; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; peroxisome proliferator; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; sex hormone; sirtuin 1; transcription factor Nrf2; urate transporter; fluorocarbon; actin filament; adverse event; apoptosis; Article; chronic kidney failure; data extraction; energy metabolism; environmental exposure; epithelial mesenchymal transition; exposure; glomerulus filtration rate; glucose metabolism; glutathione metabolism; health; homeostasis; human; hyperplasia; hypertrophy; kidney fibrosis; kidney function; kidney mass; mortality; nephrotoxicity; oxidative stress; pharmacokinetics; prevalence; protein binding; proteinuria; public health; risk factor; treatment outcome; urea nitrogen blood level; adverse event; kidney disease; pollutant; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbon Polymers; Humans; Kidney Diseases"

Nevertheless, the results from epidemiological studies exploring the associations remain inconsistent and contradictory. We thus conducted an analysis of data currently available to examine the association between PFOA exposure in early life and risk of childhood adiposity. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies that examined the impact of PFOA exposure in early life on childhood adiposity. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to pool the statistical estimates. We identified ten prospective cohort studies comprising 6076 participants with PFOA exposure. The overall effect size (relative risk or odds ratio) for childhood overweight was 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.50; I2 = 40.5%). In addition, exposure to PFOA in early life increased the z-score of childhood body mass index (β = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.17; I2 = 27.9%). Accordingly, exposure to PFOA in early life is associated with an increased risk for childhood adiposity. Further research is needed to verify these findings and to shed light on the molecular mechanism of PFOA in adiposity. © 2018 by the authors.

It is one of the most serious reproductive conditions, posing substantial risks to the baby and potentially fatal for the mother. The causes of preeclampsia are largely unknown and environmental contaminants merit further investigation. The aim of this review was to determine the association between environmental chemical exposures and preeclampsia. PubMed was searched for articles examining a priori chemical exposures and preeclampsia through April 2018. Studies were included in our review if they included at least 10 cases, evaluated preeclampsia independent of gestational hypertension, and used either measured or modeled exposure assessments. Our review contained 28 investigations examining persistent organic pollutants (POP) (6 studies), drinking water contaminants (1 study), atmospheric pollutants (11 studies), metals and metalloids (6 studies), and other environmental contaminants (4 studies). There were an insufficient number of investigations on most chemicals to draw definitive conclusions, but strong evidence existed for an association between preeclampsia and cadmium (Cd). There is suggestive evidence for associations between nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), particulate matter (PM) 2.5 , and traffic exposure with preeclampsia. There is evidence for an association between preeclampsia and Cd but insufficient literature to evaluate many other environmental chemicals.

We conducted a rapid systematic review on breastfeeding practices and serum concentrations of PFASs—specifically PFOS and PFOA—among reproductive-aged women and young children using the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology. Recent findings: We included 14 studies examining associations between breastfeeding and PFASs in infants/toddlers or pregnant/postnatal women. Breastfeeding was significantly associated with lower PFASs exposure among women and higher PFASs exposure among children. Summary: We concluded there was “sufficient” evidence supporting an association between breastfeeding and serum PFASs concentrations among women, and “limited” evidence of an association among children due to issues with sample size, confounding, and exposure assessment. These findings reinforce that lactation is an important excretion route of PFASs for women, and that breast milk may be an important exposure pathway for young children. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; adult; analysis; blood; breast feeding; breast milk; environmental exposure; female; human; infant; metabolism; pregnancy; Adult; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Breast Feeding; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant; Milk, Human; Pregnancy"

Although epidemiological studies suggest that PFASs can disrupt thyroid hormones, the association between PFAS exposure and thyroid function remains inconclusive. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and thyroid hormones. Methods We searched medical literature databases for articles on the association between PFASs–perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)–and thyroid hormone levels in adults. Twelve articles were included in the meta-analysis, and the pooled z values were calculated with correlation or regression coefficients. Results The blood PFOS concentration was positively correlated with free T4. The pooled z value was 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03, 0.08). PFOS was negatively correlated with total T4 and total T3 when excluding outlier studies. In a subgroup analysis stratified by mean PFOS concentration, PFOS was observed to be positively associated with free T4 and TSH and negatively associated with total T3 in the intermediate concentration group (8–16 ng/mL). PFOA concentration was negatively correlated with total T4 (z value, -0.06; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.03) after omitting one outlier study. PFHxS also showed a negative correlation with total T4 (z value, -0.04; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.01). A subgroup analysis of pregnant women showed that there was no association between PFASs and thyroid hormones. Conclusions Our meta-analysis suggests that PFASs are negatively associated with total T4, and their effect can be different depending on the PFAS concentration. © 2018 Kim et al.

Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis. Results: Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9-14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend. Conclusions: For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe. © 2018 The Author(s).",

Almost all studies were done in low-exposed populations. There are nine new studies, adding 6,019 births to the previous 6,937 births. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 studies. To combine all results, we approximated results for untransformed PFOA from nine studies using log-transformed PFOA. We also included another large study, excluded from previous analyses, in a sensitivity analysis. Results: We found a change of birthweight of −10.5 g (−16.7, −4.4) for every ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood. After adding one previously excluded large study, we found little evidence of an association (−1.0 g; 95% CI = −2.4, 0.4). Restricting to studies where blood was sampled from mothers early in the pregnancy or shortly before conception (5,393 births), we found little association of PFOA with birthweight (−3.3 g [−9.6, 3.0]). In studies where blood was sampled late in the pregnancy (7563 pregnancies), lower birthweight was associated with higher PFOA (−17.8 [−25.0, −10.6]). Conclusion: Present human evidence provides only modest support for decreased birthweight with increasing PFOA. Studies with a wide range of exposure, and studies with blood sampled early in pregnancy, showed little or no association of PFOA with birthweight.

However, few studies have evaluated the effect of this exposure on cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool-age children. The health and disease development paradigm (DOHaD) proposes that the physiological and metabolic adaptations triggered by the exposure to these compounds, coupled with postnatal conditions, can modify the risk of disease. In this context, cardiometabolic risk factors in children are not only an important outcome derived from prenatal exposure but a predictor/mediator of the children’s future health. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the evidence published in the last 10 years from cohort studies on the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and cardiometabolic risk factors in preschoolers. Design: Studies published from January 1, 2007 to May 1, 2017 in PubMed were analyzed. The research strategy was based on specified keywords and following the application of strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, 16 studies were identified and reviewed. Data were extracted and aspects of quality were assessed using an adapted Newcastle–Ottawa scale for cohort studies. Results: Only 5 of the 16 studies reviewed analyzed cardiometabolic risk factors in addition to anthropometric measures in children. The cohort studies included in this review suggest that prenatal exposure to low concentrations of EDCs has an impact on anthropometric variables and biochemical parameters in preschool-age children. Positive associations between prenatal exposure to EDCs and percentage of fat mass, body mass index, waist circumference, skinfolds and risk of overweight persisted after adjustment for important confounding variables. No association was found with lipid profile and glucose levels. Conclusions: Evidence was found to suggest that prenatal exposure to EDCs is positively associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool children. © 2018 The Author(s).","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2,5 dichlorophenol; adiponectin; arsenic; C reactive protein; cadmium; cholesterol; endocrine disruptor; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lead; leptin; mercury; oxybenzone; perfluorooctane; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; phthalic acid derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; triclosan; endocrine disruptor; abdominal circumference; anthropometric parameters; body height; body mass; body weight; cardiometabolic risk; child; childhood obesity; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; diastolic blood pressure; fat mass; female; glucose level; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; human; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; prenatal exposure; preschool child; Review; skinfold thickness; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; waist to height ratio; cardiovascular disease; child health; metabolic disorder; pregnancy; prevention and control; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Humans; Metabolic Diseases; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"

Breast cancer's long latency and multifactorial etiology make evaluation of these chemicals in humans challenging. Objective For chemicals previously identified as mammary gland toxicants, we evaluated epidemiologic studies published since our 2007 review. We assessed whether study designs captured relevant exposures and disease features suggested by toxicological and biological evidence of genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, tumor promotion, or disruption of mammary gland development. Methods We systematically searched the PubMed database for articles with breast cancer outcomes published in 2006–2016 using terms for 134 environmental chemicals, sources, or biomarkers of exposure. We critically reviewed the articles. Results We identified 158 articles. Consistent with experimental evidence, a few key studies suggested higher risk for exposures during breast development to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dioxins, perfluorooctane-sulfonamide (PFOSA), and air pollution (risk estimates ranged from 2.14 to 5.0), and for occupational exposure to solvents and other mammary carcinogens, such as gasoline components (risk estimates ranged from 1.42 to 3.31). Notably, one 50-year cohort study captured exposure to DDT during several critical windows for breast development (in utero, adolescence, pregnancy) and when this chemical was still in use. Most other studies did not assess exposure during a biologically relevant window or specify the timing of exposure. Few studies considered genetic variation, but the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported higher breast cancer risk for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in women with certain genetic variations, especially in DNA repair genes. Conclusions New studies that targeted toxicologically relevant chemicals and captured biological hypotheses about genetic variants or windows of breast susceptibility added to evidence of links between environmental chemicals and breast cancer. However, many biologically relevant chemicals, including current-use consumer product chemicals, have not been adequately studied in humans. Studies are challenged to reconstruct exposures that occurred decades before diagnosis or access biological samples stored that long. Other problems include measuring rapidly metabolized chemicals and evaluating exposure to mixtures. © 2017 The Authors","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 1,3 butadiene; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acrylamide; aromatic amine; carcinogen; chlorphenotane; dioxin; drinking water; endocrine disruptor; environmental chemical; ethylene oxide; flame retardant; gasoline; nonylphenol; organic solvent; organochlorine derivative; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoroalkyl substance; pesticide; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polyfluoroalkyl substance; solvent; styrene; unclassified drug; atmospheric pollution; cancer; database; DDT; DNA; endocrine disruptor; environmental fate; epidemiology; etiology; occupational exposure; risk factor; toxicology; tumor; adolescence; air pollution; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; breast development; cancer epidemiology; cancer risk; consumer; DNA repair; environmental exposure; genetic variation; geographic distribution; human; occupational exposure; pregnancy; priority journal; Review; systematic review; work environment; animal; breast tumor; chemically induced; female; genetics; mortality; pollutant; toxicity; Changdao Islands; China; Shandong; Animalia; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans"

Environmental pollutants include mercury, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalates. This study sought to classify the effects of such compounds on fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment and behavioral problems, allergic disease and immune function and the endocrine system and puberty. These evidences showed ETS has been associated with infant birth weight, children's neurodevelopment and allergy disease; mercury and PCB have been shown to affect children's neurodevelopment; phthalate has effects on endocrine function; PFAS alters children's neurodevelopment, the endocrine system, and the allergic response. However, more consistent and coordinated research is necessary to understand the whole picture of single environmental and/or co-exposure and children's health.

Singly and in combination, these toxicants may have contributed significantly to the increasing rates of breast cancer observed over the past several decades. Exposures early in development from gestation through adolescence and early adulthood are particularly of concern as they re-shape the program of genetic, epigenetic and physiological processes in the developing mammary system, leading to an increased risk for developing breast cancer. In the 8 years since we last published a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, hundreds of new papers have appeared supporting this link, and in this update, the evidence on this topic is more extensive and of better quality than that previously available. Conclusion: Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies, as well as a better understanding of mechanisms linking toxicants with development of breast cancer, all reinforce the conclusion that exposures to these substances - many of which are found in common, everyday products and byproducts - may lead to increased risk of developing breast cancer. Moving forward, attention to methodological limitations, especially in relevant epidemiological and animal models, will need to be addressed to allow clearer and more direct connections to be evaluated. © 2017 The Author(s).","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; aldrin; alkylphenol; aromatic amine; atrazine; cadmium; chlorphenotane; chromium; dieldrin; diethylstilbestrol; estrogen; ethinylestradiol; gestagen; iron; malathion; mercury; nickel; oral contraceptive agent; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sunscreen; triclocarban; triclosan; unindexed drug; zinc; adolescence; cancer; disease incidence; endocrine disruptor; epidemiology; nightglow; phenolic compound; physiology; pregnancy; radiation exposure; toxicity; African American; body mass; breast cancer; breast density; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cancer susceptibility; carcinogenicity; case control study; cell interaction; cohort analysis; computed tomographic angiography; computer assisted tomography; electromagnetism; epigenetics; female infertility; fluoroscopy; genotype environment interaction; gestational age; hormone substitution; human; in vitro study; ionizing radiation; longitudinal study; mammography; Mexican American; nonhuman; occupational exposure; ovariectomy; ovary cancer; ovulation induction; physical activity; postmenopause; practice guideline; premenopause; priority journal; prospective study; retrospective study; Review; risk benefit analysis; smoking; systematic review; ultraviolet radiation; breast tumor; chemically induced; dangerous goods; environmental exposure; female; incidence; pollutant; toxicity; Animalia; Breast Neoplasms; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Incidence"

An extensive search for toxicological information in rats and mice, and a systematic search for epidemiological evidence were conducted. The linear regression coefficient (LRC) of birth weight (BrthW) on PFOA/PFOS was considered, and separate random effects meta-analyses for untransformed (i.e. not mathematically transformed) and log-transformed values were performed. Toxicological evidence: PFOA: 12 studies (21 datasets) in mice showed statistically significant lower birth/fetal weights from 5 mg/kg body weight per day. PFOS: most of the 13 studies (19 datasets) showed lower birth/fetal weights following in utero exposure. Epidemiological evidence: Sixteen articles were considered. The pooled LRC for a 1 ng/mL increase in untransformed PFOA (12 studies) in maternal plasma/serum was −12.8 g (95% CI −23.2; 2.4), and −27.1 g (95% CI −50.6; −3.6) for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL PFOA (nine studies). The pooled LRC for untransformed PFOS (eight studies) was −0.92 g (95%CI −3.4; 1.6), and for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL was −46.1(95% CI −80.3; −11.9). No consistent pattern emerged for study location or timing of blood sampling. Conclusions: Epidemiological and toxicological evidence suggests that PFOA and PFOS elicit a decrease in BrthW both in humans and rodents. However, the effective animal extrapolated serum concentrations are 102–103 times higher than those in humans. Thus, there is no quantitative toxicological evidence to support the epidemiological association, thus reducing the biological plausibility of a causal relationship. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; birth weight; blood level; blood sampling; epidemiological data; fetus; fetus growth; fetus weight; human; linear regression analysis; maternal blood; maternal plasma; medical literature; nonhuman; prenatal exposure; Review; statistical significance; systematic review; animal; drug effects; environmental exposure; epidemiological monitoring; female; fetus development; maternal exposure; mouse; rat; toxicity testing; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Birth Weight; Caprylates; Environmental Exposure; Epidemiological Monitoring; Female; Fetal Development; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Mice; Rats; Toxicity Tests"

A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed for studies on PFAS and child health outcomes. We identified 64 studies for inclusion and performed risk of bias analysis on those studies. We determined that risk of bias across studies was low to moderate. Six categories of health outcomes emerged. These were: immunity/infection/asthma, cardio-metabolic, neurodevelopmental/attention, thyroid, renal, and puberty onset. While there are a limited number of studies for any one particular health outcome, there is evidence for positive associations between PFAS and dyslipidemia, immunity (including vaccine response and asthma), renal function, and age at menarche. One finding of note is that while PFASs are mixtures of multiple compounds few studies examine them as such, therefore the role of these compounds as complex mixtures remains largely unknown. © 2017 by the authors.

Following rapid weight loss such as when induced by bariatric surgery, an increased release of potential harmful lipophilic compounds into the blood circulation may occur. Weight reduction is recommended for overweight and obese individuals in order to decrease risk of weight-related health problems. However, in cases of significant weight reduction POP become mobilized chemicals and consequently may adversely affect health, including endocrine disruption. The objective of the present investigation was to estimate quantitatively the level of mobilization of POP following weight loss over time. According to literature search criteria, 17 studies were identified with 2061 participants. Data from 5 of the studies with 270 participants were used to assess the change in blood levels of POP in percent per kilogram weight loss. Weight loss in the included studies varied from 4.4 to 64.8 kg. In all studies, the majority of POP concentrations in blood were found to rise following weight reduction. Blood concentrations following weight reduction were elevated by 2–4% per kilogram weight loss for most POP examined. The increased POP levels were still elevated 12 mo after intervention. Most research in this field, including animal studies, is carried out on a single compound or group of selected compounds, not taking the “cocktail effect” into consideration. This does not reflect the true range of POP to which humans are actually exposed. Few chronic investigations have been published and, in particular, few studies were available that compared the increase in POP concentrations with clinical consequences as individuals lost weight. These limitations call for caution in interpreting results. The benefits of losing weight still far outweigh the potential adverse health risks. However, further studies are recommended to determine the clinical significance of increased blood levels of POPs following rapid and excessive weight loss, particularly for women attending weight reduction treatment before pregnancy. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © Aina Jansen, Jan L.

Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and thyroid outcomes during the early stages of life. We aimed to review this evidence. Methods We conducted a systematic review in compliance with the PRISMA Statement (search conducted in PubMed and Embase, as well as in the citations of the selected articles). We chose studies if they dealt with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), or thyroid dysfunctions, and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measured in the blood of pregnant women and/or children up to 19 years old. Results We included in this review three cross-sectional, one case-control, and six cohort studies (publication: 2011–2015), focusing on prenatal life (n = 7), childhood (n = 2) or both periods (n = 1). We observed a high degree of heterogeneity across studies in terms of sampling time (different gestational weeks, at birth, or childhood), outcomes, adjustment for potential confounders, and statistical approach. We found some evidence of a positive association between PFHxS and PFOS exposure and TSH levels measured in maternal blood, and PFNA and TSH levels measured in the blood of boys aged ≥ 11 years. Conclusion Although there is a small number of studies with comparable data, we found some consistency of a positive association between maternal or teenage male exposure to some PFAS and TSH levels based on the current literature. However, further studies are required to confirm these possible relationships. © 2016 The Authors","Hormones; Sampling; Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS); Perfluorononanoic acids; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Prenatal and infant exposure; Thyroid; Blood; liothyronine; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perflexane; blood; child health; cohort analysis; epidemiology; pollution exposure; pregnancy; sulfonate; womens health; birth; case control study; childhood; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; data base; epidemiological data; exposure; human; maternal blood; pregnant woman; prenatal period; Review; systematic review; thyroid disease; thyroid function; thyroid hormone blood level; adolescent; child; drug effects; environmental exposure; female; male; pollutant; pregnancy; thyroid gland; toxicity; Adolescent; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Child; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Male; Pregnancy; Thyroid Gland"

They cause a range of adverse effects to human health and the environment around the world. There is growing concern that POPs may increase breast cancer risk due to their xenoestrogenic properties. The aim of this systematic literature review is to summarize and integrate the risks of breast cancer following environmental exposure to POPs (other than DDT) from primary epidemiological studies published between 2006 and 2015. After searching various databases, 14 case-control studies and one cohort study were included. Evidence of an association between increased breast cancer risk and environmental exposure to these chemicals is inconsistent and inadequate to conclude with certainty. However, most of the studies have examined exposure to the pollutants after diagnosis of breast cancer, overlooking exposure during critical windows of vulnerability. They have also largely focused on individual chemicals but ignored the combined effects of different chemicals. Therefore, major data gaps remain in examining exposure during critical windows of vulnerability and assessing combined effects of multiple chemicals. Development of better exposure assessment methods addressing these gaps is required for future research. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","bioaccumulation; cancer; cohort analysis; database; DDT; environmental assessment; environmental risk; epidemiology; health risk; literature review; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; organic compound; pollutant; adverse effects; breast tumor; chemically induced; chemistry; environmental exposure; female; human; pollutant; toxicity; Breast Neoplasms; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Organic Chemicals"

The relation of PFASs to fertility has now been examined in a relatively large number of epidemiologic studies and a synthesis is in order. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFASs and measures of human fertility, with particular emphasis on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Systematic literature searches were initially conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE and subsequently in references and citations of included papers. Studies were included if they assessed exposure to PFASs in biological samples in relation to reproductive hormones, semen characteristics, or time to pregnancy (TTP). Study characteristics and results were abstracted to predefined forms, and the studies were assessed for the risk of bias and confounding. Sixteen studies investigated the association between PFAS exposure in men and semen parameters, reproductive hormone levels, or TTP. There was a lack of consistent results among the numerous investigated exposure-outcome combinations. However, subtle associations between higher PFOS and lower testosterone or abnormal semen morphology cannot be excluded. Eleven studies assessed the association between PFAS exposure in women and TTP or reproductive hormones levels. Four of eight studies found prolonged TTP with higher PFOS or PFOA, but only one study found an association when restricting to nulliparous women. In men, there is little evidence of an association between PFAS exposure and semen quality or levels of reproductive hormones. For PFOS and PFOA, the literature indicates an association with female fecundability in parous women, which is most likely not causal. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","alkyl group; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pollutant; environmental exposure; female; fertility; hormone determination; human; infertility; male; outcome assessment; Review; risk assessment; semen analysis; systematic review; time to pregnancy; drug effects; fertility; pollutant; reproduction; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Environmental Pollutants; Fertility; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Reproduction"

In order to rank and contextualize these results, we used the pooled GMs to calculate residential intake from dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal uptake from air, and then identified hazard traits from the Safer Consumer Products Candidate Chemical List. Our results indicate that U.S. indoor dust consistently contains chemicals from multiple classes. Phthalates occurred in the highest concentrations, followed by phenols, RFRs, fragrance, and PFASs. Several phthalates and RFRs had the highest residential intakes. We also found that many chemicals in dust share hazard traits such as reproductive and endocrine toxicity. We offer recommendations to maximize comparability of studies and advance indoor exposure science.

Findings of recent prospective studies and meta-analyses have corroborated previous good evidence, often at lower exposure levels, for effects on foetal growth of air pollution and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for neurotoxic effects of lead, methylmercury, PCBs and organophosphate pesticides, and for respiratory health effects of air pollution. Moderate evidence has emerged for a potential role of environmental pollutants in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism (lead, PCBs, air pollution), respiratory and immune health (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene - DDE - and PCBs), and obesity (DDE). In addition, there is now moderate evidence that certain chemicals of relatively recent concern may be associated with adverse child health outcomes, specifically perfluorooctanoate and foetal growth, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers and neurodevelopment. For other chemicals of recent concern, such as phthalates and bisphenol A, the literature is characterised by large inconsistencies preventing strong conclusions. In conclusion, since most of the recent literature evaluates common exposures in the general population, and not particularly high exposure situations, this accumulating body of evidence suggests that the unborn and young child require more protection than is currently provided. Large, coordinated research efforts are needed to improve understanding of long-term effects of complex chemical mixtures. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.","pollutant; child; child development; child health; drug effects; fetus development; human; immune system; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; obesity; pollutant; Premature Birth; Respiratory Tract Diseases; toxicity; Child; Child Development; Child Health; Environmental Pollutants; Fetal Development; Humans; Immune System; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Obesity; Premature Birth; Respiratory Tract Diseases"

Using literature from the past 30 years (N = 159), we conducted a meta-analysis of organic contaminants (OCs) in Chinese sludge. Most data were available from developed and populated regions, and no data were found for Tibet. Since 1987, 35 classes of chemicals consisting of 749 individual compounds and 1 mixture have been analyzed, in which antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were the most targeted analytes. For 13 classes of principal OCs (defined as chemicals detected in over five studies) in sludge, the median (expressed in nanograms per gram dry weight) was the highest for phthalate esters (27 900), followed by alkylphenol polyethoxylates (12 000), synthetic musks (5800), antibiotics (4240), PAHs (3490), ultraviolet stabilizers (670), bisphenol analogs (160), organochlorine pesticides (110), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (100), pharmaceuticals (84), hormones (69), perfluorinated compounds (21), and polychlorinated biphenyls (15). Concentrations of PAHs in sludges collected between 1998 and 2012 showed a decreasing trend. Study findings suggest the need for a Chinese national sewage sludge survey to identify and regulate toxic OCs, ideally employing both targeted as well as nontargeted screening approaches. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","Antibiotics; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Esters; Health risks; Organic pollutants; Sewage sludge; Sludge disposal; Organic contaminant; Organochlorine pesticides; Perfluorinated compounds; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Polyethoxylates; Screening approaches; Ultraviolet stabilizers; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; alkylphenol polyethoxylate derivative; antibiotic agent; antioxidant; aromatic amine; chlorinated hydrocarbon; hexabromocyclododecane; hormone derivative; musk; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoro compound; phenol derivative; phthalic acid ester; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; polychlorinated naphthalene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; pyrrole derivative; quaternary ammonium derivative; siloxane; stabilizing agent; triclocarban; triclosan; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; diphenyl ether derivative; pesticide; sewage; antibiotics; concentration (composition); drug; health risk; hormone; literature review; meta-analysis; organic compound; organic pollutant; organochlorine pesticide; PAH; PBDE; PCB; phthalate; public health; sewage treatment; sludge; biomass; chemical oxygen demand; China; concentration (parameters); geographic distribution; gross national product; human; organic pollution; population density; Review; sludge; spatiotemporal analysis; systematic review; Tibet; waste water management; chemistry; environmental monitoring; meta analysis; sewage; China; Xizang; Environmental Monitoring; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Pesticides; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Sewage"

Accordingly, this article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and various immune-related health conditions in humans. Twenty-four epidemiologic studies have reported associations of PFOA and/or PFOS with immune-related health conditions, including ten studies of immune biomarker levels or gene expression patterns, ten studies of atopic or allergic disorders, five studies of infectious diseases, four studies of vaccine responses, and five studies of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions (with several studies evaluating multiple endpoints). Asthma, the most commonly studied condition, was evaluated in seven studies. With few, often methodologically limited studies of any particular health condition, generally inconsistent results, and an inability to exclude confounding, bias, or chance as an explanation for observed associations, the available epidemiologic evidence is insufficient to reach a conclusion about a causal relationship between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and any immune-related health condition in humans. When interpreting such studies, an immunodeficiency should not be presumed to exist when there is no evidence of a clinical abnormality. Large, prospective studies with repeated exposure assessment in independent populations are needed to confirm some suggestive associations with certain endpoints. © 2016 Exponent, Inc.

Several consensus statements and narrative reviews in recent years have divided the scientific community and have elicited a call for systematic transparent reviews. We aimed to fill this gap in knowledge in the field of male reproductive disorders. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this study was to systematically synthesize published data on the risk of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm counts and testicular cancer following in utero or infant exposure to chemicals that have been included on the European Commission's list of Category 1 endocrine disrupting chemicals defined as having documented adverse effects due to endocrine disruption in at least one intact organism. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase to identify epidemiological studies reporting associations between the outcomes of interest and exposures documented by biochemical analyses of biospecimens including maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue as well as amnion fluid, cord blood or breast milk; this was followed by meta-analysis of quantitative data. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 1314 references among which we identified 33 papers(28 study populations) fulfilling the eligibility criteria. These provided 85 risk estimates of links between persistent organic pollutants and rapidly metabolized compounds (phthalates and Bisphenol A) and male reproductive disorders. The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and outcomes was 1.11 (95% CI 0.91-1.35). When assessing four specific chemical subgroups with sufficient data for meta-analysis for all outcomes, we found that exposure to one of the four compounds, p,p'-DDE, was related to an elevated risk: OR 1.35 (95% CI 1.04-1.74). The data did not indicate that this increased risk was driven by any specific disorder. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The current epidemiological evidence is compatible with a small increased risk of male reproductive disorders following prenatal and postnatal exposure to some persistent environmental chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors but the evidence is limited. Future epidemiological studies may change the weight of the evidence in either direction. No evidence of distortion due to publication bias was found, but exposure-response relationships are not evident. There are insufficient data on rapidly metabolized endocrine disruptors and on specific exposure-outcome relations. A particular data gap is evident with respect to delayed effects on semen quality and testicular cancer. Although high quality epidemiological studies are still sparse, future systematic and transparent reviews may provide pieces of evidence contributing to the narrative and weight of the evidence assessments in the field. © The Author 2016.","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 1,1,1 trichloro 2 (2 chlorophenyl) 2 (4 chlorophenyl)ethane; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; beta hexachlorocyclohexane; chlordane; chlorphenotane; di (2 ethylhexyl)phthalate; dieldrin; endocrine disruptor; heptachlor epoxide; hexachlorobenzene; mirex; mono (2 ethylhexyl)phthalate; mono n butyl phthalate; nonylphenol; octylphenol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid; phthalic acid dibutyl ester; polybrominated biphenyl; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; unclassified drug; endocrine disruptor; xenobiotic agent; adipose tissue; amnion fluid; Article; biochemical analysis; blood analysis; breast milk; cryptorchism; human; hypospadias; male; maternal blood; meta analysis; odds ratio; persistent organic pollutant; placenta; postnatal exposure; prenatal exposure; priority journal; risk assessment; spermatozoon count; systematic review; testis cancer; umbilical cord blood; urinalysis; adverse effects; chemically induced; cryptorchism; environmental exposure; epidemiology; female; hypospadias; neoplasm; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; risk factor; semen analysis; testis tumor; Cryptorchidism; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hypospadias; Male; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Risk Factors; Semen Analysis; Testicular Neoplasms; Xenobiotics"

This association could be attributable to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is related to PFAS concentration and birth weight. OBJECTIVES: We used a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of pregnancy to assess how much of the PFAS–birth weight association observed in epidemiologic studies might be attributable to GFR. METHODS: We modified a PBPK model to reflect the association of GFR with birth weight (estimated from three studies of GFR and birth weight) and used it to simulate PFAS concentrations in maternal and cord plasma. The model was run 250,000 times, with variation in parameters, to simulate a population. Simulated data were analyzed to evaluate the association between PFAS levels and birth weight due to GFR. We compared simulated estimates with those from a meta-analysis of epidemiologic data. RESULTS: The reduction in birth weight for each 1-ng/mL increase in simulated cord plasma for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was 2.72 g (95% CI: –3.40, –2.04), and for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 7.13 g (95% CI: –8.46, –5.80); results based on maternal plasma at term were similar. Results were sensitive to variations in PFAS level distributions and the strength of the GFR–birth weight association. In comparison, our meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies suggested that each 1-ng/mL increase in prenatal PFOS and PFOA levels was associated with 5.00 g (95% CI: –21.66, –7.78) and 14.72 g (95% CI: –8.92, –1.09) reductions in birth weight, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results of our simulations suggest that a substantial proportion of the association between prenatal PFAS and birth weight may be attributable to confounding by GFR and that confounding by GFR may be more important in studies with sample collection later in pregnancy. © 2015 Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of epidemiologic studies evaluating the association between environmental chemicals with DNA methylation levels in adults. After excluding arsenic, recently evaluated in a systematic review, we identified a total of 17 articles (6 on cadmium, 4 on lead, 2 on mercury, 1 on nickel, 1 on antimony, 1 on tungsten, 5 on persistent organic pollutants and perfluorinated compounds, 1 on bisphenol A, and 3 on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). The selected articles reported quantitative methods to determine DNA methylation including immunocolorimetric assays for total content of genomic DNA methylation, and microarray technologies, methylation-specific quantitative PCR, Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA), and bisulfite pyrosequencing for DNA methylation content of genomic sites such as gene promoters, LINE-1, Alu elements, and others. Considering consistency, temporality, strength, dose-response relationship, and biological plausibility, we concluded that the current evidence is not sufficient to provide inference because differences across studies and limited samples sizes make it difficult to compare across studies and to evaluate sources of heterogeneity. Important questions for future research include the need for larger and longitudinal studies, the validation of findings, and the systematic evaluation of the dose-response relationships.

The most commonly studied PFASs are perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Animal studies indicate that maternal PFAS exposure is associated with reduced fetal growth. However, the results of human studies are inconsistent. Objectives: To summarize the evidence of an association between exposure to PFASs, particularly PFOS and PFOA, and human fetal growth. Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE. We included original studies on pregnant women with measurements of PFOA or PFOS in maternal blood during pregnancy or the umbilical cord and associations with birth weight or related outcomes according to the PFAS level. Citations and references from the included articles were investigated to locate more relevant articles. Study characteristics and results were extracted to structured tables. The completeness of reporting as well as the risk of bias and confounding were assessed. Results: Fourteen studies were eligible. In utero PFOA exposure was associated with decreased measures of continuous birth weight in all studies, even though the magnitude of the association differed and many results were statistically insignificant. PFOS exposure and birth weight were associated in some studies, while others found no association. Conclusions: Higher PFOS and PFOA concentrations were associated with decreased average birth weight in most studies, but only some results were statistically significant. The impact on public health is unclear, but the global exposure to PFASs warrants further investigation. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pollutant; birth weight; cord serum; environmental exposure; fetus growth; gestational age; human; low birth weight; maternal blood; outcome assessment; pregnant woman; Review; small for date infant; umbilical cord; adverse effects; animal; drug effects; female; fetus development; pollutant; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; toxicity; Animalia; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Birth Weight; Caprylates; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetal Development; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome"

Over the last decade there have been increasing reports in the epidemiological literature of the potential association of exposure to polybromo diphenylethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) with neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects in infants and children, such as adverse birth outcomes, cognitive deficits, developmental delay and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). However, direct evidence from epidemiology studies has been limited and contradictory. Given the general lack of comparability across studies in terms of design, conduct, methodology and reporting, we developed a checklist-type quality assessment scheme based on the STROBE guidelines and the proposed HONEES criteria, and conducted a systematic review of the epidemiological peer-reviewed literature published since 2006 on neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects following prenatal and postnatal exposure to PBDEs and PFCs. We rated 7 of the 18 studies that met our inclusion criteria as being of high quality, 7 of moderate quality and 4 of low quality. Frequently observed shortcomings were the lack of consideration of confounding factors; uncertainties regarding exposure characterization; inadequate sample size; the lack of a clear dose-response; and the representativeness/generalizability of the results. Collectively, the epidemiological evidence does currently not support a strong causal association between PBDEs and PFCs and adverse neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural outcomes in infants and children. However, despite their limitations, the studies raise questions that require further investigation through hypothesis-driven studies using more harmonized study designs and methodologies, more detailed exposure assessments and repeated testing with larger study populations. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","perfluoro compound; polybrominated diphenyl ether; diphenyl ether derivative; fluorocarbon; adverse outcome; Article; attention deficit disorder; developmental disorder; human; neurotoxicity; pregnancy outcome; prenatal exposure; quality control; systematic review; brain; child; child behavior; child development; cognition; drug effects; female; fetus; motor activity; pregnancy; toxicity; Brain; Child; Child Behavior; Child Development; Cognition; Female; Fetus; Fluorocarbons; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Motor Activity; Pregnancy"

The studies fell under the following categories: paediatric (n=18), reproductive health (n=18), obstetrics and gynaecology (n=9), cardiology (n=7), bone health (n=2), oncology (n=2), endocrinology (n=2) and other (n=2). All studies, except one from Arctic Finland, were either from Nunavik or Greenland. Most studies assessed polychlorinated biphenyls (n=43) and organochlorine pesticides (n=29). Fewer studies examined heavy metals, perfluorinated compounds, or polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Details of study results for each health category are provided.CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to make conclusive statements about the effects of environmental contaminants on health due to mixed results, small number of studies and studies being restricted to a small number of regions. Meta-analytical synthesis of the evidence should be considered for priority contaminants and health outcomes. The following research gaps should be addressed in future studies: association of contaminants and health in other Arctic regions (i.e. Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut, Nunatsiavut, Alaska, European North and Russian North); assessment of contaminants on chronic diseases; inclusion of clinical endpoints in assessments; and assessment of the emerging contaminants of perfluorinated compounds and polybrominated diphenyl ethers.BACKGROUND: Since the 1990s, research has been carried out to monitor environmental contaminants and their effects on human health in the Arctic. Although evidence shows that Arctic indigenous peoples are exposed to higher levels of contaminants and do worse on several dimensions of health compared with other populations, the contribution of such exposures on adverse outcomes is unclear.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to provide a synopsis of the published epidemiological literature that has examined association between environmental contaminants and health outcomes in Arctic indigenous populations.DESIGN: A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline (1946-January 2014) using search terms that combined concepts of contaminant and indigenous populations in the Arctic. No language or date restrictions were applied. The reference lists of review articles were hand-searched.","pesticide; pollutant; polychlorinated biphenyl; adverse effects; Arctic; chemistry; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; female; health status; human; male; pollutant; population group; procedures; statistics and numerical data; United States; Alaska; Arctic Regions; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Pesticides; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Population Groups"

These tissue concentrations may then be compared with in vitro bioactivity assays to perhaps identify mechanisms relevant to the lowest observed effect level (LOEL) dose group and the onset of the observed in vivo toxicity. Here, we examine the perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS). We analyzed 9 in vivo toxicity studies for PFOA and 13 in vivo toxicity studies for PFOS. Both PFCs caused multiple effects in various test species, strains, and genders. We used a Bayesian pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling framework to incorporate data from 6 PFOA PK studies and 2 PFOS PK studies (conducted in 3 species) to predict dose metrics for the in vivo LOELs and no observed effect levels (NOELs). We estimated PK parameters for 11 combinations of chemical, species, strain, and gender. Despite divergent study designs and species-specific PK, for a given effect, we found that the predicted dose metrics corresponding to the LOELs (and NOELs where available) occur at similar concentrations. In vitro assay results for PFOA and PFOS from EPA's ToxCast project were then examined. We found that most in vitro bioactivity occurs at concentrations lower than the predicted concentrations for the in vivo LOELs and higher than the predicted concentrations for the in vivo NOELs (where available), for a variety of nonimmunological effects. These results indicate that given sufficient PK data, the in vivo LOELs dose regimens, but not necessarily the effects, could have been predicted from in vitro studies for these 2 PFCs. © The Author 2013.

But the river suffers from huge amounts of urban sewage, agricultural effluents, and industrial wastewater as well as ship navigation wastes along its course. With respect to the vast amounts of water and sediments discharged by the Yangtze River, it is reasonable to ask whether the pollution problem may be solved by simple dilution. This article reviews the past two decades of published research on organic pollutants in the Yangtze River and several adjacent water bodies connected to the main stream, according to a holistic approach. Organic pollutant levels and potential effects of water and sediments on wildlife and humans, measured in vitro, in vivo, and in situ, were critically reviewed. The contamination with organic pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and others, of water and sediment along the river was described. Especially Wuhan section and the Yangtze Estuary exhibited stronger pollution than other sections. Bioassays, displaying predominantly the endpoints mutagenicity and endocrine disruption, applied at sediments, drinking water, and surface water indicated a potential health risk in several areas. Aquatic organisms exhibited detectable concentrations of toxic compounds like PCBs, OCPs, PBDEs, and PFCs. Genotoxic effects could also be assessed in situ in fish. To summarize, it can be stated that dilution reduces the ecotoxicological risk in the Yangtze River, but does not eliminate it. Keeping in mind an approximately 14 times greater water discharge compared to the major European river Rhine, the absolute pollution mass transfer of the Yangtze River is of severe concern for the environmental quality of its estuary and the East China Sea. Based on the review, further research needs have been identified. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","benzofuran derivative; chlorinated dibenzofurans; chlorinated hydrocarbon; dibenzo(1,4)dioxin; dioxin; diphenyl ether derivative; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; anthropogenic source; aquatic organism; bioaccumulation; bioassay; dilution; drinking water; ecotoxicology; endocrine disruptor; environmental risk; fish; genotoxicity; health risk; mutagenicity; organic pollutant; organochlorine; PAH; PBDE; PCB; pollutant transport; river pollution; sediment pollution; animal; article; chemistry; China; environmental monitoring; human; river; statistics; waste water; water pollutant; water pollution; Animals; Benzofurans; China; Dioxins; Environmental Monitoring; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Pesticides; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Rivers; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical; China; Yangtze River"

Understanding the role of environmental chemicals in the development or progression of diabetes is an emerging issue in environmental health. Objective: We assessed the epidemiologic literature for evidence of associations between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and type 2 diabetes. Methods: Using a PubMed search and reference lists from relevant studies or review articles, we identified 72 epidemiological studies that investigated associations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with diabetes. We evaluated these studies for consistency, strengths and weaknesses of study design (including power and statistical methods), clinical diagnosis, exposure assessment, study population characteristics, and identification of data gaps and areas for future research. Conclusions: Heterogeneity of the studies precluded conducting a meta-analysis, but the overall evidence is sufficient for a positive association of some organochlorine POPs with type 2 diabetes. Collectively, these data are not sufficient to establish causality. Initial data mining revealed that the strongest positive correlation of diabetes with POPs occurred with organochlorine compounds, such as trans-nonachlor, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals. There is less indication of an association between other nonorganochlorine POPs, such as perfluoroalkyl acids and brominated compounds, and type 2 diabetes. Experimental data are needed to confirm the causality of these POPs, which will shed new light on the pathogenesis of diabetes. This new information should be considered by governmental bodies involved in the regulation of environmental contaminants.","1, 1 dichloro 2, 2 bis (4 chlorophenyl) ethylene; dioxin; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; nonachlor; polychlorinated biphenyl; unclassified drug; disease association; environmental exposure; human; meta analysis (topic); non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant; priority journal; review; toxicology"

As many cases are of unknown etiology, identification of the contribution of environmental contaminant exposures is a priority in the study of preterm birth. This is a comprehensive review of all known studies published from 1992 through August 2012 linking maternal exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy with preterm birth. Using PubMed searches, studies were identified that examined associations between preterm birth and exposure to five categories of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants, drinking-water contaminants, atmospheric pollutants, metals and metalloids, and other environmental contaminants. Individual studies were summarized and specific suggestions were made for future work in regard to exposure and outcome assessment methods as well as study design, with the recommendation of focusing on potential mediating toxicological mechanisms. In conclusion, no consistent evidence was found for positive associations between individual chemical exposures and preterm birth. By identifying limitations and addressing the gaps that may have impeded the ability to identify true associations thus far, this review can guide future epidemiologic studies of environmental exposures and preterm birth. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; arsenic; cadmium; dioxin; environmental chemical; lead; mercury; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; environmental exposure; gestational age; human; outcome assessment; pollutant; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; review; systematic review; Air Pollutants; Dioxins; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Metals; Pesticides; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

It has been widely detected in environmental samples but there is limited information about the health effects on humans from environmental exposure. This paper presents the findings of a review of the literature on the impact of PFOS on the health of the general population. Fifteen relevant epidemiological studies were identified that looked at the association between human PFOS exposure and a range of health related outcomes. Small but statistically significant associations have been reported with PFOS and total cholesterol, glucose metabolism, body mass index (BMI), thyroid function, infertility, breast feeding, uric acid and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The true significance of these findings is uncertain due to the inconsistencies in some of the study results and the limitations of the literature. The majority of studies were cross-sectional and considered surrogate markers of health (e.g. cholesterol levels). The available literature is also limited in ascertaining the link between PFOS concentrations in the environment, exposure pathways and health effects. We conclude that the current evidence is inconclusive and further large-scale prospective cohort studies would be useful to assess the association between environmental exposure to PFOS, appropriate biomarkers (e.g. serum levels of PFOS) and health outcomes. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","cholesterol; glucose; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; testosterone; thyroglobulin; thyroid hormone; triacylglycerol; uric acid; alkanesulfonic acid; biological marker; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; pollutant; attention deficit disorder; bladder cancer; blood level; blood sampling; body mass; breast feeding; cancer incidence; cholesterol blood level; cross-sectional study; disease association; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; gestational age; glucose metabolism; high risk population; human; insulin resistance; liver cancer; Medline; metabolic syndrome X; pancreas cancer; population research; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; prostate cancer; review; self report; smoking; systematic review; thyroid function; thyroid hormone blood level; waist circumference; metabolism; pollutant; statistics and numerical data; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Biological Markers; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons"

Objectives: To systematically review the epidemiologic literature on the adverse effects of early-life exposure to POPs on respiratory health, allergy and the immune system in infancy, childhood and adolescence. Methods: Based on published guidelines for systematic reviews, two independent researchers searched for published articles in MEDLINE and SCOPUS using defined keywords on POPs and respiratory health, immune function and allergy. Study eligibility criteria were defined to select the articles. Results: This review of 41 studies finds limited evidence for prenatal exposure to DDE, PCBs and dioxins and risk of respiratory infections. Evidence was limited also for postnatal exposure to PCBs, specifically ndl-PCBs, and reduced immune response after vaccination in childhood. The review indicates lack of association between postnatal exposure to PCBs/ndl-PCBs and risk of asthma-related symptoms. For the other exposure-outcome associations reviewed evidence was inadequate. Discussion and conclusion: Current epidemiological evidence suggests that early-life exposure to POPs can adversely influence immune and respiratory systems development. Heterogeneity between studies in exposure and outcome assessment and the small number of studies for any given exposure-outcome relationship currently make comparisons difficult and meta-analyses impossible. Also, mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Recommendations for significantly improving our understanding thus include harmonization of exposure and outcome assessment between studies, conduct of larger studies, long-term assessment of respiratory infections and asthma symptoms in order to identify critical periods of susceptibility, integration of the potential immunotoxic mechanisms of POPs, and use of new statistical tools to detangle the role of multiple exposures on multiple outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Allergies; Diseases; Immunology; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Respiratory system; Statistical mechanics; Adverse effect; Children; Critical periods; Cytokines; Immune function; Immune response; Immune systems; Medline; Meta analysis; Multiple exposure; Outcome assessment; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Postnatal exposure; Prenatal exposure; Respiratory tract infections; Statistical tools; Systematic Review; Organic pollutants; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; dioxin; furan derivative; hexachlorobenzene; perfluoro compound; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; allergy; child health; DDE; environmental risk; health risk; immune system; organic pollutant; PCB; persistence; pollution exposure; respiratory disease; allergic asthma; atopy; cellular immunity; human; humoral immunity; immunopathology; infection risk; outcome assessment; perinatal period; prenatal exposure; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; respiratory tract infection; review; systematic review; vaccination"

There is also evidence that ED exposure has trans-generational effects. In this systematic review, we evaluate the evidence for an association between EDC exposure and women's reproductive health. Methods: Studies were found by searching the PubMed database for articles published up to 2010. Associations between ED exposure and women's reproductive health reported in the PubMed database are summarized and classified as fertility and fecundity, pregnancy outcomes, transgenerational exposure and effects. Results: Epidemiological studies on EDCs are not always consistent, in part due to limitations imposed by practical constraints. In order to make progress in this field, we recommend taking advantage of biomonitoring and biobanks, including the development of appropriate biomarkers, and taking into greater consideration modulating factors such as genetic polymorphisms and dietary habits. Further human studies are warranted with particular focus on impaired fertility/fecundity associated with currently widespread ED (e.g. bisphenol A, phthalates and polybrominated flame retardants). Conclusions: A detailed appraisal of compounds specifically related to adverse reproductive outcomes is very important for prevention and risk-communication strategies. Besides research needs, the current evidence is sufficient to prompt precautionary actions to protect women's reproductive health. © The Author 2011.
