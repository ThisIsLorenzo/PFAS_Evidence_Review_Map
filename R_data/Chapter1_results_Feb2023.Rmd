# Intro

**Project title:** PFAS exposure of humans, animals and environmental compartments: an evidence review map and bibliometric analysis

In this document I provide the results of my Evidence Review Map (Chapter 1 of my thesis). Results are organized in 3 objectives.

# Project's objectives

-   **Objective 1** *Mapping*

What evidence on PFAS has been systematically synthesized?

I aim to reveal what areas in the realm of PFAS health-related and environmental research have been synthesized the most and where syntheses of evidence are lacking.

-   **Objective 2** *Critical appraisal*

How robust are systematic syntheses of PFAS evidence?

I examine the included syntheses for their reporting quality and potential biases, in order to assess reliability of reviews' conclusions, reveal syntheses that should be re-done, and highlight the aspects of review methodology that need to be improved.

-   **Objective 3** *Bibliometrics*

How is synthesized PFAS evidence connected?

I examine which countries and institutions are mostly involved in secondary PFAS research and what do the networks between these institutions look like.

# Search and screening outcomes

![PRISMA flowchart](R_data/PRISMA_diagram.png)

-   109 included systematic reviews (SRs)

*However, we have 42 more SRs found during an update search up to end 2022.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Objective 1

**Mapping**: What evidence on PFAS has been systematically synthesized?

![](R_data/1_combined.png)

-   Humans are the most reviewed subject in SRs on PFAS exposure, with 82 SRs, followed by multiple subjects (12), environmental compartments (8), and animals (7).

-   "Humans" and "toxicity" were the most frequently used MeSH terms across all subjects, followed by "fluorocarbons" and "chemically induced".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](R_data/2_combined.png)

-   Most SRs investigated multiple types of PFAS, with PFOA and PFOS being the most reviewed PFAS types, followed by PFHxs, PFNA, and PFDA.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](R_data/3+4_combined.png)

-   The number of SRs published annually has steadily increased over time, with a significant spike in 2021.

-   Recent syntheses are less likely to include quantitative synthesis through meta-analysis.

-   The increase in published SRs over the years is due to SRs on humans.

-   Reviews after 2019 tend to focus on PFAS and not on POPs in general.

-   PFCA and PFSA are still the two most reviewed groups.

-   PFAS with a short or long carbon chain are less reviewed than PFAS with a medium-length carbon chain.

# Objective 2

**Critical appraisal**: How robust are systematic syntheses of PFAS evidence?

![](R_data/5_combined.png)

-   Most SRs included a statement regarding conflicts of interest and few acknowledged the potential presence of COI.

-   Most SRs reported receiving funding, with the majority funded by non-profit organizations.

-   Most SRs did not make their raw data or analysis code available, limiting the ability to verify findings or replicate analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](R_data/AMSTAR2_summary.png)

-   Over 50% of the SRs received poor scores (i.e., 0 or 0.5 scores) on a majority of AMSTAR 2 questions, indicating a need for improvement in the rigor and quality of the literature.

-   The highest scoring assessment questions related to clarity of explanation and reporting of conflict of interest.

-   The lowest scoring questions related to transparency measures, such as reporting sources of funding of the included studies and list excluded studies.

-   Many SRs lacked clear research questions and inclusion criteria, established review methods prior to the conduct of the review, and used a comprehensive literature search strategy.

-   Many SRs also had limited reviewer involvement in study selection and data extraction, and inadequate techniques for assessing the risk of bias and discussing heterogeneity and publication bias.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](R_data/6_combined.png)

-   Only half of the recent SRs follow reporting guidelines.

-   Recent SRs are more likely to include a conflict-of-interest statement and a funding statement than earlier reviews.

-   Almost all the reviews are founded by no-profit organizations.

## Supplementary materials

Quality of reviews (AMSTAR2 score) differs according to field of research, publication year, review type, publication source. *work in progress*
