To analyze the evolution of the concentration and prevalence of POPs such as Î±-HCH, Î²-HCH, Î³-HCH, âˆ‘-HCH, Heptachlor, Aldrin, p,pâ€²-DDE, p,pâ€²-DDT, âˆ‘-DDT, and âˆ‘-OCP in water resources, a search between January 01, 1970, to February 10, 2020, was followed using a systematic review and meta-analysis prevalence. Among the 2306 explored articles in the reconnaissance step, 311 articles with 5315 exemplars, 56 countries, and 4 types of water were included in the meta-analysis study. Among all studied POPs, the concentration of p,pâ€²-DDT in water resources was the highest, especially in drinking water resources. The overall rank order based on the concentration and prevalence of POPs were surface water > drinking water > seawater > groundwater. To identify POPs-contaminated areas, the distance from the mean relative to their distribution was considered. The most to the least polluted areas included: South Africa, India, Turkey, Pakistan, Canada, Hong Kong, and China. The highest carcinogenic risk was observed for Î²-HCH (Turkey and China), followed by Î±-HCH (Mexico). The highest non-carcinogenic risk was identified for Aldrin (all analyzed countries), followed by Dieldrin (Turkey) and Î³-HCH (Mexico). The Monte Carlo analysis (under the assumption that Î³-HCH has a normal distribution), the mean obtained was 8.22Eâˆ’07 for children and 3.83Eâˆ’07 for adults. This is in accordance with the standard risk assessment approach. In terms of percentiles, the Monte-Carlo approach indicates that 75% of child population is under the 1.07Eâˆ’06 risk and 95% of adults under 7.35Eâˆ’06.

Sediment is an important environmental reservoir for PFOA, while polluted sediment can serve as a long-term contamination source causing pollution to overlying surface water and surrounding groundwater. Here, the source, pollution level, adsorption and transport of PFOA at the sediment-water interface were systematically reviewed. Industrial discharge was the major release for PFOA entering surface water and sediment. PFOA was generally at ngâ€¢L-1 and ngâ€¢g-1 levels in global surface water and sediment. More serious pollution was found in some parts of China. Sediment composition, hadrochemical condition, natural organic matter, and surfactants could strongly affect PFOA adsorption in sediment, though the controlling mechanisms were controversial. Research on PFOA transport in sediment had just been started with limited progress. There is a great gap in understanding the mechanisms underlying PFOA transport in sediment, which should be strengthened in the future. Â© 2021, Science Press.

rayyan-798176037,Association between urinary per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances and COVID-19 susceptibility,2021,NA,NA,"Background and Objective: The growing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the urgency of identifying individuals most at risk of infection. Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are manufactured fluorinated chemicals widely used in many industrial and household products. The objective of this case-control study was to assess the association between PFASs exposure and COVID-19 susceptibility and to elucidate the metabolic dysregulation associated with PFASs exposure in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Total 160 subjects (80 COVID-19 patients and 80 symptom-free controls) were recruited from Shanxi and Shandong provinces, two regions heavily polluted by PFASs in China. Twelve common PFASs were quantified in both urine and serum. Urine metabolome profiling was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: In unadjusted models, the risk of COVID-19 infection was positively associated with urinary levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (Odds ratio: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.52â€“3.22]), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (2.91, [1.95â€“4.83], and total PFASs (âˆ‘ (12) PFASs) (3.31, [2.05â€“4.65]). After controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), the associations remained statistically significant (Adjusted odds ratio of 1.94 [95% CI: 1.39â€“2.96] for PFOS, 2.73 [1.71â€“4.55] for PFOA, and 2.82 [1.97â€“3.51] for âˆ‘ (12) PFASs). Urine metabolome-PFASs association analysis revealed that 59% of PFASs-associated urinary endogenous metabolites in COVID-19 patients were identified to be produced or largely regulated by mitochondrial function. In addition, the increase of PFASs exposure was associated with the accumulation of key metabolites in kynurenine metabolism, which are involved in immune responses (Combined Î² coefficient of 0.60 [95% CI: 0.25â€“0.95, P = 0.001]). Moreover, alternations in PFASs-associated metabolites in mitochondrial and kynurenine metabolism were also correlated with clinical lab biomarkers for mitochondrial function (serum growth/differentiation factor-15) and immune activity (lymphocyte percentage), respectively. Conclusion: Elevated exposure to PFASs was independently associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. PFASs-associated metabolites were implicated in mitochondrial function and immune activity. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings and further understand the underlying mechanisms of PFASs exposure in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection.

A continuous evaluation is needed to combine the inconsistent results. In this study, we explored the associations between PFASs exposure and the low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA). The quality of selected literature, quantitative estimates, publication bias and subgroup analysis were performed on the basis of 17 retrieved articles published before December 2020. The results showed a significant positive association between the perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure and the risk of LBW[Odds ratio (OR)=1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.36; heterogeneity: P=0.30, I2=17%]. The positive association was also observed between the PFOS and the risk of preterm birth (OR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.39, P=0.007; I2=62%). There was a paucity of evidence regarding the negative effects of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) on the pregnancy outcomes. The findings from the subgroup analysis (the sampling period, the birth gender and biologic specimens) did not substantially altered the results of the overall pooled estimate ORs. The increased prevalence of negative birth outcomes with gestational PFASs exposure warrants further explorations from biological process perspective.

rayyan-798176051,A critical review of modeling Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in the soil-water environment,2021,NA,NA,"Due to their health effects and the recalcitrant nature of their C[sbnd]F bonds, Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are widely investigated for their distribution, remediation, and toxicology in ecosystems. However, very few studies have focused on modeling PFAS in the soil-water environment. In this review, we summarized the recent development in PFAS modeling for various chemical, physical, and biological processes, including sorption, volatilization, degradation, bioaccumulation, and transport. PFAS sorption is kinetic in nature with sorption equilibrium commonly quantified by either a linear, the Freundlich, or the Langmuir isotherms. Volatilization of PFAS depends on carbon chain length and ionization status and has been simulated by a two-layer diffusion process across the air water interface. First-order kinetics is commonly used for physical, chemical, and biological degradation processes. Uptake by plants and other biota can be passive and/or active. As surfactants, PFAS have a tendency to be sorbed or concentrated on air-water or non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL)-water interfaces, where the same three isotherms for soil sorption are adopted. PFAS transport in the soil-water environment is simulated by solving the convection-dispersion equation (CDE) that is coupled to PFAS sorption, phase transfer, as well as physical, chemical, and biological transformations. As the physicochemical properties and concentration vary greatly among the potentially thousands of PFAS species in the environment, systematic efforts are needed to identify models and model parameters to simulate their fate, transport, and response to remediation techniques. Since many process formulations are empirical in nature, mechanistic approaches are needed to further the understanding of PFAS-soil-water-plant interactions so that the model parameters are less site dependent and more predictive in simulating PFAS remediation efficiency.

Long term consequences of the newborns' contamination by PFAS on thyroid function are of concern. The aim of this study is to assess the potential associations between PFAS contamination measured at birth and thyroid function assessed few months later. PFAS levels were previously determined in cord blood from a cohort of newborns recruited in Liege. METHOD: Parents of the children belonging to the first and the fifth quintiles of exposure to PFAS were contacted in order to measure the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in their child few months after birth. Twenty-eight children participated in the study. Moreover, we performed a literature review about associations between pre- or perinatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants and thyroid function during early childhood. RESULT: No significant difference was highlighted between both groups of contamination (Mann-Whitney, p-value = 0.91). Literature review highlighted the critical need of new longitudinal data about this problematic.

rayyan-798176108,A critical review of the application of polymer of low concern and regulatory criteria to fluoropolymers,2018,NA,NA,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of fluorinated substances that are in the focus of researchers and regulators due to widespread presence in the environment and biota, including humans, of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Fluoropolymers, high molecular weight polymers, have unique properties that constitute a distinct class within the PFAS group. Fluoropolymers have thermal, chemical, photochemical, hydrolytic, oxidative, and biological stability. They have negligible residual monomer and oligomer content and low to no leachables. Fluoropolymers are practically insoluble in water and not subject to long-range transport. With a molecular weight well over 100 000 Da, fluoropolymers cannot cross the cell membrane. Fluoropolymers are not bioavailable or bioaccumulative, as evidenced by toxicology studies on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE): acute and subchronic systemic toxicity, irritation, sensitization, local toxicity on implantation, cytotoxicity, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, hemolysis, complement activation, and thrombogenicity. Clinical studies of patients receiving permanently implanted PTFE cardiovascular medical devices demonstrate no chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity and no reproductive, developmental, or endocrine toxicity. This paper brings together fluoropolymer toxicity data, human clinical data, and physical, chemical, thermal, and biological data for review and assessment to show that fluoropolymers satisfy widely accepted assessment criteria to be considered as â€œpolymers of low concernâ€ (PLC). This review concludes that fluoropolymers are distinctly different from other polymeric and nonpolymeric PFAS and should be separated from them for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes.

rayyan-798176111,Lipid metabolism alteration by endocrine disruptors in animal models: An overview,2018,NA,NA,"Exposure to potential Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) pose a documented risk to both wildlife and human health. Many studies so far described declining sperm counts, genital malformations, early puberty onset, highlighting the negative impact on reproduction caused by the exposure to many anthropogenic chemicals. In the last years, increasing evidence suggested that these compounds, other than altering reproduction, affect metabolism and induce the onset of obesity and metabolic disorders. According to the â€œenvironmental obesogensâ€ hypothesis, evidence exists that exposure to potential EDCs during critical periods when adipocytes are differentiating, and organs are developing, can induce diseases that manifest later in the life. This review summarizes the effects occurring at the hepatic level in different animal models, describing morphological alterations and changes of molecular pathways elicited by the toxicant exposure. Results currently available demonstrated that these chemicals impair normal metabolic processes via interaction with members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including steroid hormone receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, retinoid X receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, and farnesoid X receptors. In addition, novel results revealed that EDC exposure can either affect circadian rhythms as well as up-regulate the expression of signals belonging to the endocannabinoid system, in both cases leading to a remarkable increase of lipid accumulation. These results warrant further research and increase the interest toward the identification of new mechanisms for EDC metabolic alterations. The last part of this review article condenses recent evidences on the ability of potential EDCs to cause â€œtransgenerational effectsâ€ by a single prenatal or early life exposure. On this regard, there is compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link developmental environmental insults to adult disease susceptibility. This review will contribute to summarize the mechanisms underlying the insurgence of EDC-induced metabolic alterations as well as to build integrated strategies for their better management. In fact, despite the large number of results obtained so far, there is still a great demand for the development of frameworks that can integrate mechanistic and toxicological/epidemiological observations. This would increase legal and governmental institution awareness on this critical environmental issue responsible for negative consequences in both wild species and human health.

rayyan-798176121,Progress on analytical methods and environmental behavior of emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,2017,NA,NA,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of anthropogenic chemicals widely used in manufacture and daily necessities, which are contaminants ubiquitous existed in various environmental matrices and biota. Due to the persistent, bioaccumulative, long-range transport and potential toxic behaviors, production of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid was voluntarily phased out. Perfluorooctanoic acid, its salt and related compounds were also proposed to be included the Stockholm Convention. Restrictions on production and usage of PFAS chemicals have resulted in emergence of novel PFAS compounds through direct manufacturing emissions and indirect transformation pathways, and increasing attention has been focused on these alternatives. In this review, we summarized recent investigations on major groups of emerging PFASs with various molecular structures, and current analytical strategies on the identification of unknown organic fluoride components were overviewed. Four classes of emerging PFASs are covered, including short-chain perfluoroalkyl substances, cyclic perfluoroalkyl acids, perfluoropolyethers and chlorine or hydrogen-substituted polyfluoroalkyl substances. Current knowledge on molecular structures, production and application, environmental behaviors and potential biological effects are summarized, if available. Known PFASs were noticed as a small part of organic fluorinated compounds in the environment. Consequently, new analytical strategies, such as the mass balance analysis and the oxidative conversion methods, were developed for the analysis of unknown fluorinated components. Mass balance analysis of extractable organic fluorine were used to predict the content of unknown organic fluorine in various environmental matrices including sea water, soil, and human blood. Extractable organic fluorine could be exactly quantified after conversion into inorganic fluoride by high-temperature combustion, and known fluorinated components could also be measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The difference in contents between extractable organic fluorine and known fluorinated components was thus considered as components of unknown organic fluorine. The oxidative conversion method was especially superior for the analysis of fluorinated precursors such as fluorotelomer sulfonates, perfluoroalkane sulfonamides and fluorotelomer phosphate diesters, in which these poly-fluoroalkyl substances could be transformed into known perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) by reaction with hydroxyl radicals at basic conditions. The content of polyfluoroalkyl precursors could be determined by comparing the change of PFCAs contents before and after the oxidation assay. Compared with the mass balance analysis method, this oxidative conversion method require quantification of more PFAS terminal products, and it was not applicable for stable perfluorinated compounds. Meanwhile, occurrence of a variety of novel PFAS analogues have brought challenges on PFAS analysis. For instance, varied molecular structures of emerging PFASs result in distinct physical-chemical properties, which further complicate the analytical process including sample pretreatment and chromatographic isolation. Development of additional methods, such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) for the analysis of short chain PFASs and orthogonal liquid chromatography for the analysis of zwitterionic, cationic, and anionic fluorinated chemicals, are urgently needed. Statistical tools including mass spectrum deconvolution, peak picking, alignment and feature filtering would be promising for confirmation of novel PFAS molecular structures. Also, environmental transformation of PFAS precursors are still ambiguous. Application of strategies in metabolomics analysis might facilitate studies on degradation mechanism of PFAS chemicals.

The toxicity of these compounds far outweighs the usefulness of these compounds. Male reproductive health is linked to the process of spermatogenesis and there is a general consensus that males are more sensitive to these environmental contaminants and so significantly affected when compared to their female counterparts. The review discusses the various toxic contaminants polluting the environment and the effect of these compounds on spermatogenesis and its relevance on male infertility in humans. It provides a detailed report on the chemical nature of few selected reprotoxicants like estrogen analogues, phthalates, dioxins, heavy metals and their action mechanism on various cellular targets that play a role in spermatogenesis with special highlights at the genetic and molecular levels. Understanding the toxicity of these compounds serves a dual purpose; to develop counter measures to protect ourselves from cellular damage and to use these compounds as a model to better understand the intricate process of spermatogenesis.

rayyan-798176140,Occurrence of persistent organic pollutants in sediments and biota from Portugal versus European incidence: A critical overview,2016,NA,NA,"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are widespread compounds, such as organohalogenated compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pesticides, which can be found in all types of environmental compartments. Their presence in the aquatic environment is a worldwide problem, with emphasis on sediments which act as depository and consequently as a source of hydrophobic, recalcitrant and harmful compounds. Besides, these pollutants might affect the reproduction and mortality of living organisms, diverging in their potential to bioaccumulate in tissues. The present paper aims to review the occurrence of POPs in sediments and biota from the coastal, estuarine and river areas of Portugal. The list of the studied compounds comprises organohalogenated compounds, PAHs, organometallic compounds, pesticides, sterols, fatty acids and pharmaceutical compounds. The contamination of sediments by various pollutants is presented, such as PAHs up to 7,350 ng gâˆ’1 found in Sado estuary and polychlorinated biphenyls up to 62.2 ng gâˆ’1 in the case of sediments collected in Ria de Aveiro. The occurrence of these persistent toxic substances in sediments demonstrates aquatic contamination from agricultural, industrial and urban discharges and the concern about the potential risks to aquatic organisms, wildlife and humans. In fact, several classes of POPs have also been found in biota, such as polychlorinated biphenyls up to 810.9 ng gâˆ’1 in sentinel fish from the Douro River estuary and pesticides in bivalves from the Sado River estuary. The importance of further systematic research on sediments and biota is here highlighted to compare the contamination of these two reservoirs; to assess their spatial and temporal variation; and to determine other classes of POPs that were not investigated yet (e.g., industrial compounds, estrogens and many classes of pharmaceuticals).

rayyan-798176170,Evidence for the involvement of xenobiotic-responsive nuclear receptors in transcriptional effects upon perfluoroalkyl acid exposure in diverse species,2009,NA,NA,"Humans and ecological species have been found to have detectable body burdens of a number of perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAA) including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). In mouse and rat liver these compounds elicit transcriptional and phenotypic effects similar to peroxisome proliferator chemicals (PPC) that work through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARÎ±). Recent studies indicate that along with PPARÎ± other nuclear receptors are required for transcriptional changes in the mouse liver after PFOA exposure including the constitutive activated receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) that regulate xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME). To determine the potential role of CAR/PXR in mediating effects of PFAAs in rat liver, we performed a meta-analysis of transcript profiles from published studies in which rats were exposed to PFOA or PFOS. We compared the profiles to those produced by exposure to prototypical activators of CAR, (phenobarbital (PB)), PXR (pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)), or PPARÎ± (WY-14,643 (WY)). As expected, PFOA and PFOS elicited transcript profile signatures that included many known PPARÎ± target genes. Numerous XME genes were also altered by PFOA and PFOS but not WY. These genes exhibited expression changes shared with PB or PCN. Reexamination of the transcript profiles from the livers of chicken or fish exposed to PFAAs indicated that PPARÎ±, CAR, and PXR orthologs were not activated. Our results indicate that PFAAs under these experimental conditions activate PPARÎ±, CAR, and PXR in rats but not chicken and fish. Lastly, we discuss evidence that human populations with greater CAR expression have lower body burdens of PFAAs."," | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not review,not a review"

The goal of the Galician Emerging Food Safety Risks Network (RISEGAL) is the identification of emerging risks in foods produced and commercialized in Galicia (northwest Spain) in order to propose prevention plans and mitigation strategies. In this work, RISEGAL applied a systematic approach for the identification of emerging food safety risks potentially affecting bivalve shellfish. First, a comprehensive review of scientific databases was carried out to identify hazards most quoted as emerging in bivalves in the period 2016-2018. Then, identified hazards were semiquantitatively assessed by a panel of food safety experts, who scored them accordingly with the five evaluation criteria proposed by EFSA: novelty, soundness, imminence, scale, and severity. Scores determined that perfluorinated compounds, antimicrobial resistance, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, hepatitis E virus (HEV), and antimicrobial residues are the emerging hazards that are considered most imminent and severe and that could cause safety problems of the highest scale in the bivalve value chain by the majority of the experts consulted (75%).

Furniture, electronics, personal care and cleaning products, floor coverings and other consumer products contain chemicals that can end up in the indoor air and settled dust. Consumer product chemicals such as phthalates, phenols, flame retardants and per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substances are widely detected in the US general population, including vulnerable populations, and are associated with adverse health effects such as reproductive and endocrine toxicity. We discuss the implications of our recent meta-analysis describing the patterns of chemical exposures and the ubiquity of multiple chemicals in indoor environments. To reduce the likelihood of exposures to these toxic chemicals, we then discuss approaches for exposure mitigation: targeting individual behaviour change, household maintenance and purchasing decisions, consumer advocacy and corporate responsibility in consumer markets, and regulatory action via state/federal policies. There is a need to further develop evidence-based strategies for chemical exposure reduction in each of these areas, given the multi-factorial nature of the problem. Further identifying those at greatest risk; understanding the individual, household and community factors that influence indoor chemical exposures; and developing options for mitigation may substantially improve individuals' exposures and health."," | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: mitigation,It doesn't concern bio, enviro, medical aspects of burdens"
rayyan-798176185,Endocrine disruptors: Evidence from epidemiological studies necessitates a critical review of model systems,2017,BUNDESGESUNDHEITSBLATT-GESUNDHEITSFORSCHUNG-GESUNDHEITSSCHUTZ,NA,"Endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs) cause adverse health effects through interaction with endocrine systems. They are classified by chemical structure, effects on specific endocrine systems, bioaccumulation, persistence in the environment, or clinically observable effects. For research of the complex mechanisms of action in the human body, only in vitro model systems have so far been available, that have insufficient high-throughput capacity, which makes risk evaluation more difficult. In addition, in industrial nations, living people are often exposed to mixtures of substances, with various effects. The clinical importance of epigenetic changes caused by the action of EDCs during vulnerable phases of development is currently unclear. Epidemiological studies are criticized because reproducibility is not always guaranteed. Nevertheless, they remain the method of choice for the development and analysis of suitable model systems. Positive associations, in spite of sometimes conflicting results, are key in the selection of factors that can then be analysed in model systems in an unbiased way. This article depicts the mainly positive epidemiological findings for EDC-caused effects in the fields of growth and metabolism, neurocognitive development and sexual development and reproduction. As a result, there is a need for closer linkage between epidemiological studies and mechanistic research into model systems, especially focusing on the interaction of different EDCs and the consequences of prenatal and early life exposure."," | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text,no full-text"
rayyan-798176186,Persistent organic pollutants in Pakistan: Potential threat to ecological integrities in terms of genotoxicity and oxidative stress,2017,HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT,NA,"As a consequence of both increasing population and industrialization in agro-economic sector, Pakistan has inevitably been confronted by multicomplex environmental challenges. Owing in part to poor regulatory framework, pollution due to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has caused serious problems throughout the country. Resultantly, extensive use of POPs is causing vigorous deterioration of environment and human health. The current study addresses: (1) the general information on associated ecological effects and toxicity assessment by meta-analysis for local fauna and flora (2) their respective occurrence in living organisms; and (3) sources and distribution patterns of various POPs classes in environmental compartments of Pakistan. Based on the study, it can be concluded that the environment of Pakistan is highly contaminated with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dechlorane plus (DP), and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), which is further supported with the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, unavailability of environmental quality standards and food safety for POPs render it a forthcoming challenge of multicompartment toxicity exposure. Therefore, strategies must be planned for risk assessment of biologically active POPs, while the POP waste inventory should be elevated, along with the necessary measures to promote appropriate handling and treatment of POP as a matter of prime importance."," | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not PFAS,no pfas involved"

rayyan-798176216,[Impact of endocrine disrupting chemicals on birth outcomes].,2013,Gynécologie Obstétrique & Fertilité,NA,"BACKGROUND: Endocrine disruptors are ubiquitous chemicals contaminants in the environment, wildlife, and humans. Their adverse effects on reproduction are well-documented. There is growing evidence that they can contribute to the current emergence of chronic diseases. OBJECTIVES: Our aim is to assess the relationships between endocrine disruptors and the neonatal health outcomes. METHODS: Two persons have independently reviewed Medline and Toxline databases about the following pollutants: bisphenol A, phthalates, parabens, brominated flame retardants and perfluorinated compounds. Only the human epidemiological studies, in general population with an abstract available, published between 2007 January the 1st and 2011 December the 31st, were analysed. The quality of each study was assessed with the Strobe score. RESULTS: Twenty-five out of 680 studies were included in the analysis. All pollutants were widely detected in maternal and new borns samples. Most of the studies have shown associations between bisphenol A, brominated flame retardants and perfluorinated compounds and lower birth weight. The effects on gestational age were less documented and have shown no clear connection. Results for phthalates were more ambiguous. Only one non-instructive study was found on parabens. DISCUSSION: Due to the inherent methological bias on endocrine disruptors research, further additional studies on environmental health must be investigated. It seems necessary to adopt preventive health measures first for vulnerable population.", | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: foreign language

rayyan-798176222,Exposição a desreguladores endócrinos e síndrome dos ovários policísticos: uma revisão sistemática,2017,NA,NA,"Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade de Brasília, Faculdade de Ciências da Saúde, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciências da Saúde, 2017. A síndrome dos ovários policísticos (SOPC) tem grande importância clínica, uma vez que sua prevalência vem aumentando e que apresenta implicações clínicas significativas, incluindo reprodutivas, metabólicas e psicológicas. Sua etiologia é complexa e multifatorial, e envolve fatores genéticos, ambientais e comportamentais. Dados de alguns estudos observacionais sugerem a associação entre a exposição a desreguladores endócrinos (DEs) e sua ocorrência. Objetivo: Analisar, por meio de revisão sistemática de estudos observacionais em humanos, se há associação entre a exposição a DEs e a ocorrência de SOPC. Método: Foi realizada busca, nas bases de dados PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs e Biblioteca Cochrane, de estudos observacionais em humanos que analisaram a associação entre a exposição a DEs e a ocorrência de SOPC, e publicados até maio de 2017, sem restrição de língua. A busca foi efetuada pela combinação de termos relacionados aos DEs e à SOPC. A qualidade metodológica dos estudos foi avaliada com a utilização da escala de Newcastle-Ottawa. Resultados: Foram identificados 145 artigos que atenderam aos critérios de busca; destes, 7 estudos atenderam aos critérios de inclusão. Estes estudos, de corte transversal ou caso-controle, incluídos nessa revisão, investigaram a relação entre a exposição ao bisfenol A, compostos organoclorados (bifenilas policloradas e pesticidas organoclorados), compostos perfluorado, hidrocarbonetos aromáticos policíclicos e ftalatos e a ocorrência de SOPC. Em geral, houve uma associação positiva entre a exposição a estes DEs e a ocorrência da síndrome, e os estudos foram considerados de qualidade metodológica média a elevada. Conclusão: Os dados da presente revisão sugerem a associação entre a exposição a DEs e a ocorrência de SOPC. Entretanto, todos os estudos incluídos foram observacionais e transversais, não sendo possível estabelecer relação de causalidade entre a exposiÃ§Ã£o a DEs e a SOPC. ; Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is of major clinical importance due to its increasing prevalence and its implications, including reproductive, metabolic, and psychological disturbances. Its etiology is complex and multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental and behavioral aspects. Data from observational studies suggest an association between exposure to endocrine dirsuptors (EDs) and the occurrence of PCOS. Objective: To systematically review human observational studies addressing the association between the exposure to EDs and PCOS. Methods: We searched Pubmed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs and Cochrane Library for studies addressing the association between EDs and PCOS from inception until May 2017, with no language restriction. The searched was performed by combining search terms related to EDs and PCOS. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: We identified 145 citations and 7 met our inclusion criteria. The studies were cross-sectional or case-controle studies and investigated the association between bisphenol A, organochlorine compounds (polychlorinated bisphenyls and organochloride pesticides), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phthalates and PCOS occurrence. Overall, the studies indicated a positive association between exposure to EDs and PCOS. Most studies were considered of medium or high methodological quality. Conclusion: This systematic review indicates an association between exposure to EDs and the occurrence of PCOS. However, their cross-sectional design precludes establishing causality between EDs and PCOS."," | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not PFAS,foreign language"
rayyan-798176223,"Age-related changes of leaf traits and stoichiometry in an alpine shrub (Rhododendron agglutinatum) along altitudinal gradient (vol 14, pg 106, 2017)",2017,NA,NA,"China has gradually become the most important manufacturing and consumption centre for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the world, and inadvertently become the world's major contamination hotspots. However, a systematic analysis of pollution pathways for PFOS/PFOA into the different environmental compartments and their quantification in China has yet to be carried out. This study focused on PFOS and PFOA release into the environment in the central and eastern region of China, which accounts for the vast majority of national emission. About 80-90% of PFOS/PFOA contamination in the Chinese environment was estimated to come directly from manufacturing and industrial sites mostly via wastewater discharge from these facilities. The other major contamination sources for PFOS were identified as being linked to aqueous fire-fighting foams (AFFFs), and pesticides including suifluramid. For PFOA, following some way behind industrial wastewater, were industrial exhaust gas, domestic wastewater and landfill leachate as contamination sources. For surface water contamination, the major pollution contributors after industrial wastewater were AFFF spill runoff for PFOS, and domestic wastewater and precipitation-runoff for PFOA. The majority of PFOS that contaminated soil was considered to be linked with infiltration of AFFF and pesticides, while most PFOA in soil was attributed to atmospheric deposition and landfill leachate. Where groundwater had become contaminated, surface water seepage Was estimated to contribute about 50% of PFOS and 40% of PFOA while the remainder Was mostly derived from soil leaching. A review of the available monitoring data for PFOS/PFOA in the literature supported the view that industrial wastewater, landfill leachate and AFFF application were the dominant sources. Higher concentrations of PFOA than PFOS found in precipitation also corroborated the prediction of more PFOA release into air. To reduce PFOS/PFOA contamination of the Chinese environment the focus for control should be on industrial wastewater emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
